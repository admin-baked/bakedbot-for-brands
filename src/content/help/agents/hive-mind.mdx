# Agent Collaboration (Hive Mind)

Your AI agents don't work in isolation—they collaborate, share insights, and coordinate actions to deliver better results than any single agent could alone.

## What is the Hive Mind?

**The Hive Mind is how agents work together:**
- 🧠 **Shared memory** - Agents access collective intelligence
- 🤝 **Coordinated actions** - Agents collaborate on complex tasks
- 📊 **Unified insights** - Data flows between agents seamlessly
- 🔄 **Continuous learning** - Each agent improves the whole system
- ⚡ **Faster decisions** - Agents leverage each other's expertise

<Callout type="success">
**Example:** Craig creates a campaign, Ezal checks competitor pricing, Money Mike optimizes prices, Deebo ensures compliance, then Craig finalizes—all automatically, in seconds.

## Conflict Resolution

### When Agents Disagree

**Example conflict:**

```
Money Mike: "Raise Blue Dream to $40"
(Reasoning: Market average is $42, opportunity for profit)

Pops: "Keep Blue Dream at $35"
(Reasoning: Top seller, price-sensitive customers)

Conflict Resolution:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Leo (COO) evaluates:
- Money Mike's data: +$600/month profit potential
- Pops' data: -15% volume risk at higher price
- Calculates: Net impact = +$280/month

Decision: Compromise
→ Raise to $38 (middle ground)
→ Test for 2 weeks
→ Monitor sales volume
→ Adjust if volume drops > 10%

## Best Practices

<Callout type="tip">
**Trust the collaboration:** Agents are designed to work together. Don't micromanage each step.

**Review outputs:** While agents collaborate well, you should still review final recommendations before approval.

**Provide feedback:** When approving/rejecting, add notes. Agents learn from your decisions.

**Let agents communicate:** Don't manually coordinate between agents—they handle it automatically.

**Check activity log:** Monitor agent collaboration to understand how decisions are made.
