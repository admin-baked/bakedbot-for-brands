Agents don't work in isolation - they collaborate and share information:

### Example Workflow: New Product Launch

1. **You**: Add new product to catalog
2. **Smokey**: Starts recommending it to customers
3. **Craig**: Creates launch campaign with compliance-checked copy
4. **Deebo**: Validates all marketing claims are legal
5. **Ezal**: Checks competitor pricing for positioning
6. **Money Mike**: Suggests optimal launch price
7. **Pops**: Tracks campaign performance
8. **Mrs. Parker**: Adds to loyalty program offers

All automatic. All working together.

**The agents share a memory system** called "Letta" - when one agent learns something useful, the others can access that knowledge. It's like having a team that actually communicates!
