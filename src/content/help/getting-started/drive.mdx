## File Organization

### System Categories

Drive comes with five built-in categories, each optimized for a specific file type:

| Category | Max File Size | Purpose |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| **Agents** | 10 MB | Agent avatars, prompt files, configuration exports |
| **QR** | 5 MB | Generated QR codes and tracking assets |
| **Images** | 25 MB | Photos, graphics, marketing visuals |
| **Documents** | 50 MB | PDFs, spreadsheets, Word/Excel/PowerPoint files |
| **Custom** | 100 MB | Any files in user-created folders |

### Custom Folders

Create your own folders to organize files beyond the default categories:

1. Click **New Folder** in the Drive toolbar
2. Enter a folder name
3. Optionally set a color and icon
4. Files in custom folders follow the 100 MB size limit

### Folder Navigation

- **Breadcrumb trail** at the top shows your current location
- **Folder tree** on the left provides quick navigation
- Click any folder to browse its contents
- Folders support nesting (subfolders within folders)

### Upload Dialog

1. Click the **Upload** button in the toolbar
2. Select files from your computer
3. Choose a destination folder or category
4. Files upload to Firebase Storage and appear in Drive immediately

### URL Upload

Upload files from a web URL:

1. Click **Upload > From URL**
2. Paste the file URL
3. Drive downloads and stores the file

## Viewing Files

### Grid View

Displays files as cards with thumbnails (for images), file type icons, name, and size. Best for browsing visual assets.

### List View

Displays files in a table with columns for name, size, type, date modified, and actions. Best for sorting and managing large collections.

Toggle between views using the grid/list icons in the toolbar.

## File Details

Each file tracks:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Name** | File name with extension |
| **Type** | MIME type (auto-detected) |
| **Size** | Formatted file size (KB, MB) |
| **Downloads** | Total download count |
| **Views** | Total view count |
| **Tags** | Custom tags for organization |
| **Description** | Optional notes about the file |
| **Created** | Upload date and time |
| **Modified** | Last modification date |

## Sharing Files

### Access Control Levels

Five tiers of access control for shared files:

| Level | Who Can Access |
|-------|---------------|
| **Public** | Anyone on the internet |
| **Link-Only** | Only people with the exact share link (unlisted) |
| **Email-Gated** | Requires email entry to access — captures leads |
| **Users-Only** | Specific invited users only |
| **Private** | Owner only (default) |

### Share Permissions

For each share, set what recipients can do:

- **View** — Preview the file in browser
- **Download** — Download a copy
- **Edit** — Modify the file

### Creating a Share

1. Select a file or folder
2. Click **Share** (or right-click > Share)
3. Choose an access control level
4. Set optional restrictions:
   - **Password protection** — Requires a password to access
   - **Expiration date** — Share link expires after a set date
   - **Download limit** — Maximum number of downloads allowed
5. Copy the share link

<Callout type="tip">
**Email-gated sharing** is excellent for lead generation. Share product catalogs, brand guides, or sell sheets with an email gate to capture contact information from interested parties.
</Callout>

### Access Tracking

Every share logs access events:

- Who viewed or downloaded (user ID, email, or IP)
- When they accessed it
- What action they took (view vs. download)

---

## Trash

Deleted files move to Trash rather than being permanently removed:

- Click the **X** or **Delete** on any file to move it to Trash
- View Trash to see deleted files
- Restore files from Trash if needed
- Trash is a soft delete — files can be recovered

---

## Storage

Files are stored in Firebase Storage under the path:

```
drive/{userId}/{category}/{filename}
```

File metadata, folder structure, and sharing information are stored in Firestore collections:

- `drive_files` — File metadata and properties
- `drive_folders` — Folder hierarchy and settings
- `drive_shares` — Share links, permissions, and access logs

---

## Best Practices

### Do's

- **Use categories** — Keep agents, QR codes, images, and documents in their respective system folders
- **Tag files** — Add tags to make files searchable and organized
- **Use email-gated sharing** — Capture leads when sharing marketing assets externally
- **Set expiration dates** — Time-limit shares for sensitive documents
- **Check access logs** — Monitor who is accessing your shared files

### Don'ts

- **Don't upload sensitive credentials** — Drive is for business assets, not passwords or API keys
- **Don't exceed file size limits** — Each category has a max size; compress large files if needed
- **Don't share without intent** — Review access control before creating share links
