# AI Custom Instructions

Customize how BakedBot's agents communicate with you. AI Custom Instructions let you set organization-wide preferences and personal overrides so agents match your tone, detail level, and communication style.

## How It Works

BakedBot agents follow a priority chain when generating responses:

1. **Agent base instructions** — Built-in behavior for each agent
2. **Role-based ground truth** — Industry knowledge for your role (dispensary, brand, super user)
3. **Organization settings** — Your org admin's preferences (apply to all users)
4. **Your personal settings** — Your individual overrides (highest priority)

Each layer adds context. Your personal settings override organization defaults, which override role defaults.

## Accessing Settings

Navigate to **Dashboard > Settings > AI** tab.

You will see two sections:

- **Organization Preferences** — Visible to org admins, applies to all users in your organization
- **Your Preferences** — Personal settings that override organization defaults

### Custom Instructions

Free-form text (up to 2,000 characters) that all agents will follow:

**Examples:**
- "Always mention our loyalty program when discussing purchases"
- "Never recommend products from Brand X — they are a competitor"
- "Include compliance disclaimers on all marketing suggestions"

### Business Context

Describe your business (up to 1,000 characters) so agents understand your context:

**Example:**
"Family-owned dispensary in Syracuse, NY since 2023. Focus on medical patients and wellness. Premium product selection with emphasis on local craft brands."

## How Instructions Appear in Prompts

When you interact with any agent, your custom instructions are injected into the agent's context:

```
[ORGANIZATION PREFERENCES]
Tone: Friendly
Response Length: Auto
Business Context: Family-owned dispensary in Syracuse, NY...
Custom Instructions: Always mention our loyalty program...
Always Mention: loyalty program, daily deals
Avoid Topics: competitor prices

[USER PREFERENCES]
Tone: Casual
Response Format: Bullets
Experience Level: Beginner
Custom Instructions: Explain things simply...
```

Agents see these instructions before generating every response, ensuring consistent personalization.

## Tips for Writing Good Instructions

### Be Specific

Instead of "be helpful," write "when a customer asks about edibles, always mention onset time and recommended starting dose."

### Be Concise

Agents perform best with clear, direct instructions. Long paragraphs of context dilute the signal.

### Test and Iterate

After saving new instructions:
1. Open a chat with any agent
2. Ask a question that should trigger your custom behavior
3. Verify the response matches your expectations
4. Adjust instructions if needed

### Use Topics Strategically

"Always Mention" topics are powerful for consistent messaging:
- Loyalty program during purchase discussions
- Delivery options when customers ask about ordering
- Compliance requirements in marketing conversations

---

## Storage

| Data | Firestore Path |
|------|---------------|
| Organization settings | `tenants/{tenantId}/settings/ai` |
| User settings | `users/{userId}/settings/ai` |

Settings are loaded fresh on each agent interaction to reflect any recent changes.
