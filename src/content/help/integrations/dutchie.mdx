Please re-authorize to continue syncing.

[Re-authorize Now]
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: Connection Expired

**Symptoms:**
- Products not syncing
- "Authorization expired" error

**Cause:**
- OAuth token expired (90-day limit)

**Fix:**
1. Go to **Settings → Integrations → POS**
2. Click **"Re-authorize Dutchie"**
3. Grant permissions again
4. Sync resumes automatically

### Issue 2: Products Not Syncing

**Symptoms:**
- New products in Dutchie don't appear in BakedBot

**Causes & Fixes:**

**Cause 1: Products inactive in Dutchie**
```
In Dutchie: Check product status
- Active products sync
- Archived products don't (unless enabled)
```

**Cause 2: Sync disabled**
```
In BakedBot: Settings → POS
- Verify "Enable Sync" toggled ON
- Check last sync time
```

**Cause 3: API permissions**
```
In Dutchie: Settings → Integrations → API
- Verify "Read Products" permission enabled
- Re-authorize if permissions changed
```

### Issue 3: Inventory Mismatches

**Symptoms:**
- Stock levels in BakedBot don't match Dutchie

**Causes & Fixes:**

**Cause 1: Orders placed outside sync window**
```
If sync every 30 min:
- Order placed at 2:05pm
- Next sync at 2:30pm
- 25-minute lag normal

Solution: Reduce sync frequency to 15 min
```

**Cause 2: Reserved inventory**
```
Dutchie shows:
- Total: 25 units
- Available: 20 units (5 reserved for pending orders)

BakedBot syncs: 20 units (available only)

This is correct behavior
```

**Cause 3: Multiple sales channels**
```
If selling on:
- Dutchie website
- Your website (BakedBot)
- Third-party (Weedmaps, etc.)

Inventory may lag briefly between channels
Syncs catch up within sync interval
```

### Issue 4: Orders Not Appearing

**Symptoms:**
- Orders placed on Dutchie don't show in BakedBot

**Causes & Fixes:**

**Cause 1: Order sync disabled**
```
BakedBot: Settings → POS → Sync Options
☑ Enable: "Sync orders from Dutchie"
```

**Cause 2: Order status**
```
Only "confirmed" orders sync
- Pending orders don't sync
- Cancelled orders don't sync
```

**Cause 3: Sync lag**
```
Orders sync every 15-30 minutes
Check last sync time
Wait for next sync or trigger manual sync
```
