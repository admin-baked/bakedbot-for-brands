# Approval Queue - Your Content Review Hub

The Approval Queue at `/dashboard/approvals` is your centralized review hub for all agent-generated content. Before any campaign goes live or content gets published, it must pass through the approval queue. This gives you full control over what your AI agents produce.

<Callout type="info">
**Human-in-the-loop by design.** BakedBot agents are powerful, but every piece of customer-facing content requires your sign-off. The Approval Queue is where you maintain brand control while letting AI do the heavy lifting.
</Callout>

## What Needs Approval

Not everything agents do requires your review. Informational lookups, analytics queries, and internal research happen automatically. But anything that touches customers or goes public stops here first.

| Item Type | Source Agent | Why It Needs Approval |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Campaigns** | Craig (Marketing) | Review content, audience targeting, and compliance before sending |
| **Creative Content** | Craig, Smokey | Ensure brand consistency and regulatory compliance |
| **Outreach Drafts** | Mrs. Parker (Re-engagement) | Verify tone and offers before customer contact |
| **Playbook Steps** | Automated playbook execution | Human-in-the-loop for critical automated actions |

<Callout type="tip">
**Think of the approval queue as your editorial desk.** Agents draft, Deebo checks compliance, and you make the final call. This three-layer process keeps your brand safe while moving fast.
</Callout>

## Accessing the Approval Queue

There are three ways to reach your approval queue:

### 1. Sidebar Navigation (Primary)
Navigate to **Dashboard > Approvals** in the left sidebar. This is the main entry point and shows all pending items across every category.

### 2. Agent Notification
When an agent creates something that needs your review, you receive a notification. Click the **"Approve"** action button directly in the notification to jump to that specific item.

### 3. Inline from Inbox
When Craig presents a campaign card inside your inbox conversation, click **"Review"** on the card to open it in the approval queue with full details.

## Approval Queue Layout

The approval page is designed for fast, confident decision-making.

### Stats Bar

At the top of the page, three counters give you an at-a-glance status:

| Counter | What It Shows |
|---------|--------------|
| **Pending** | Total items waiting for your review |
| **Approved Today** | Items you approved in the current day |
| **Rejected Today** | Items you rejected in the current day |

### Filter Tabs

Below the stats bar, tabs let you filter by content type:

- **All Pending** - Everything awaiting review (default view)
- **Campaigns** - SMS, email, and social campaigns from Craig
- **Content** - Creative assets, marketing materials, sell sheets
- **Playbooks** - Automated playbook steps requiring human approval

### Item Cards

Each item in the queue displays:

- **Type icon** - Visual indicator (campaign, content, playbook step)
- **Name/title** - What the item is called
- **Source agent** - Which agent created it (Craig, Mrs. Parker, etc.)
- **Created date** - When the item was generated
- **Compliance status badge** - Deebo's automated compliance verdict
- **Approve/Reject buttons** - Primary action buttons on each card

## Campaign Approval Flow

Campaigns are the most common items in the approval queue. Here is the typical lifecycle from creation to launch.

### Step 1: Draft Created

Craig creates a campaign draft, either from a conversation you had in the inbox ("Create a 420 sale campaign") or from an automated playbook trigger. The campaign enters `draft` status.

### Step 2: Compliance Review

Deebo automatically scans the campaign content for regulatory violations. This includes:

- Medical claims check (no "cures" or "treats" language)
- Age-gating verification (21+ targeting only)
- Required disclaimers (opt-out language, THC warnings)
- State-specific rules (advertising restrictions by jurisdiction)
- Platform policies (SMS character limits, email CAN-SPAM)

### Step 3: Pending Approval

Once Deebo finishes the compliance scan, the campaign appears in your approval queue with the compliance results attached.

### Step 4: Your Review

When you open a campaign for review, you see the complete picture:

**Campaign Details:**
- Campaign name and description
- Goal (win-back, product launch, flash sale, etc.)
- Target audience with segment breakdown
- Estimated reach and send cost

**Content Preview:**
- Email subject line and body (rendered preview)
- SMS text (character count displayed)
- Social media post copy and image

**Compliance Results:**
- Pass/fail/warning status from Deebo
- Specific findings with line-by-line details
- Suggested fixes for any flagged issues

### Step 5: Approve or Reject

You have two options:

**Approve** - The campaign moves to `approved` status. It is now ready to be scheduled for sending. Approving does not send the campaign immediately; you still control when it goes out.

**Reject** - The campaign returns to `draft` status. The source agent is notified with your rejection reason so it can improve future drafts. You can optionally add notes explaining what needs to change.

<Callout type="warning">
**Approving a campaign does not send it.** After approval, you still need to schedule the campaign with a send time. Go to the campaign detail page to set the schedule, or tell Craig in chat: "Schedule campaign X for tomorrow at 10am."
</Callout>

## Compliance Status Indicators

Every item in the approval queue carries a compliance badge from Deebo's automated review. Here is what each status means:

| Status | Badge | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Passed** | Green checkmark | All compliance checks passed. Safe to approve. |
| **Warning** | Yellow triangle | Minor issues found. Review the suggestions before approving. |
| **Failed** | Red X | Violations detected. Must be fixed before you can approve. |
| **Pending** | Gray clock | Compliance check is still running. Wait for results. |

### Understanding Warnings vs. Failures

**Warnings** are advisory. They flag things that might be problematic but are not definitive violations. Examples:
- Discount percentage is unusually high (> 30%)
- Language is close to a medical claim but not explicitly one
- Send time is outside typical engagement windows

**Failures** are blocking. They indicate clear regulatory violations. Examples:
- Content contains a medical/health claim
- Missing required opt-out language in SMS
- Targeting parameters include minors

<Callout type="info">
**You can still approve items with warnings**, but take the time to review what Deebo flagged. Warnings exist to protect your brand and your license. Items with **failed** compliance should be rejected and revised.
</Callout>

## Bulk Actions

When multiple items pile up, bulk actions keep you efficient:

1. **Select items** - Click the checkbox on each item you want to act on, or use "Select All" to grab everything visible
2. **Approve All** - Approve all selected items in one click
3. **Reject All** - Reject all selected items with an optional shared reason

<Callout type="warning">
**Use bulk approve carefully.** It is tempting to "Approve All" when you have 10+ items waiting. Always at least scan the compliance badges first. Bulk approve items that show green checkmarks; review yellow warnings individually.
</Callout>

### When Bulk Actions Make Sense

- **Multiple playbook steps** from the same execution that you have already reviewed
- **A batch of creative variants** where you reviewed the first one and the rest follow the same template
- **End-of-day catchup** when you have reviewed items throughout the day and just need to formally approve them

## Creative Content Approval

Beyond campaigns, agents generate creative assets that also need your sign-off:

| Content Type | What to Check |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Carousels** | Product images, descriptions, pricing accuracy |
| **Sell Sheets** | Brand messaging, product claims, design quality |
| **QR Codes** | Destination URL, tracking parameters |
| **Event Promos** | Date/time accuracy, venue details, legal disclaimers |
| **Outreach Drafts** | Customer tone, offer validity, personalization accuracy |

For creative content, focus on:
- **Brand voice consistency** - Does it sound like your brand?
- **Factual accuracy** - Are prices, strain names, and THC percentages correct?
- **Visual quality** - Do images represent your products well?
- **Compliance** - No medical claims, proper disclaimers

## Playbook Step Approval

Playbooks are automated workflows that execute a sequence of steps. Some steps are configured to require human approval before proceeding.

**Common approval-gated steps:**
- Sending a campaign to more than 500 recipients
- Publishing content to social media
- Generating and distributing discount codes
- Customer outreach with personalized offers

When a playbook hits an approval-gated step:
1. Execution **pauses** at that step
2. The step appears in your approval queue under the **Playbooks** tab
3. You review the step details and what will happen next
4. **Approve** resumes the playbook; **Reject** stops execution

<Callout type="tip">
**Configure approval gates wisely.** Too many gates slow down automation. Too few gates risk sending something you did not intend. A good rule: require approval for anything customer-facing and anything involving spend.
</Callout>

## Best Practices

### Review Daily

Check the approval queue at least once a day to avoid bottlenecks. Pending items block campaigns from going out and playbooks from completing. If you are unavailable for extended periods, consider delegating approval access to a trusted team member.

### Do Not Skip Compliance Warnings

Even when Deebo shows "warning" rather than "failed," take a moment to read the details. Warnings are early indicators of content that could cause problems. A pattern of ignored warnings can lead to actual violations over time.

### Provide Feedback When Rejecting

When you reject an item, add a reason. This feedback helps agents improve future content. Good rejection reasons are specific:

- **Vague (not helpful):** "Not good enough"
- **Specific (helpful):** "The SMS copy mentions 'pain relief' which is too close to a medical claim. Rewrite to focus on relaxation instead."

### Set Up Notifications

Enable `approval_required` notifications in your notification settings so you get alerted immediately when new items enter the queue. This prevents items from sitting unreviewed for days.

**To enable:**
1. Go to **Dashboard > Settings > Notifications**
2. Toggle on **"Approval Required"** alerts
3. Choose your channel (dashboard, email, or SMS)

### Trust but Verify

AI agents produce high-quality content, but they are not perfect. Always review:
- **Audience targeting** - Make sure the right customers are being reached
- **Pricing and offers** - Verify discount amounts and promo codes are correct
- **Compliance details** - Confirm Deebo's automated check aligns with your local regulations
- **Tone and voice** - Ensure the content matches your brand personality

## Troubleshooting

### "No items in queue"

This is normal if agents have not generated content recently. It does not indicate a problem.

**Check these if unexpected:**
- Verify agents are active in the inbox (try asking Craig to draft a campaign)
- Confirm playbooks are running (Dashboard > Marketing > Playbooks)
- Check that your role has approval permissions (dispensary owner/manager roles)

### "Compliance check stuck on Pending"

If a campaign shows "Compliance: Pending" for more than a few minutes:

1. **Wait and refresh** - Deebo's compliance service may be processing a backlog
2. **Check after 5 minutes** - Most compliance checks complete in under 60 seconds
3. **Manual override** - If still stuck, you can approve the item manually, but review the content yourself for compliance issues before doing so

<Callout type="warning">
**Manually approving items with pending compliance** means you are taking on the compliance responsibility yourself. Only do this if you are confident the content meets all regulatory requirements for your state.
</Callout>

### "Approved but campaign is not sending"

Approving a campaign does not trigger sending. Campaigns still need to be scheduled.

**To schedule an approved campaign:**
1. Navigate to **Dashboard > Marketing > Campaigns**
2. Find the approved campaign
3. Click **"Schedule"** and set a send date/time
4. Or ask Craig in chat: "Schedule the [campaign name] for [date and time]"

### "Rejected item keeps coming back"

If an agent regenerates content that keeps getting rejected:
1. Open the inbox and talk to the source agent directly
2. Provide specific instructions on what needs to change
3. The agent will create a new draft incorporating your feedback
4. The revised item will appear in the approval queue as a new entry

## Approval Queue and Team Roles

Different team roles have different approval capabilities:

| Role | Can View Queue | Can Approve | Can Reject | Can Bulk Approve |
|------|---------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| **Owner** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Manager** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Staff** | View only | No | No | No |

<Callout type="info">
**Need to delegate approvals?** Make sure your team members have the appropriate role assigned. Go to **Dashboard > Settings > Team** to manage roles. See the [User Roles](/help/getting-started/user-roles) guide for details.
