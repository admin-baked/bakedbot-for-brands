# Dynamic Pricing Dashboard

Maximize revenue and move inventory faster with intelligent, rule-based dynamic pricing. BakedBot's pricing engine integrates with your POS system and competitor intelligence to automatically adjust prices based on inventory age, market conditions, time of day, and more.

## Why Dynamic Pricing Works

**Data-driven pricing increases profitability:**
- 💰 **+12-18% revenue** (vs. static pricing)
- 🔄 **40% faster inventory turnover** (clear aging stock)
- 🎯 **Stay competitive** (match market prices automatically)
- ⚡ **React in real-time** (demand-based adjustments)
- 📊 **Optimize margins** (balance volume vs. profit)

<Callout type="success">
**Real example:** A dispensary using dynamic pricing cleared 45+ day inventory 3x faster while maintaining margins, resulting in $23K additional revenue in the first quarter.
</Callout>

## Dashboard Overview

The Dynamic Pricing dashboard has **4 tabs:**

### 1. Rules Tab

<Callout type="success">
**Game changer:** This is the fastest way to push promotions live. No manual price updates in your POS, no waiting for syncs. Click "Publish to Menu" and customers see new prices immediately.
</Callout>

### 3. Intelligence Tab
Monitor inventory health and clearance recommendations.

**What you see:**
- **Expiring Soon**: Products approaching expiration (30-60 days)

## Publishing Prices to Your Menu

### What is "Publish to Menu"?

When you create pricing rules, they exist in the BakedBot system but **don't automatically appear on your public menu**. The "Publish to Menu" feature applies all your active pricing rules to your live menu in one click, making price changes visible to customers immediately.

**How it works:**

1. You create pricing rules (clearance, happy hour, competitor matching, etc.)
2. Click **"Publish to Menu"** in the Publish to Menu tab
3. BakedBot evaluates all active rules against your product catalog
4. Products matching rule conditions get updated prices
5. Discount badges appear next to prices on your public menu
6. Original prices are preserved for easy reverting

### When to Publish

**Best times to publish:**

- ✅ **Monday mornings** - Start the week with fresh promotions
- ✅ **Off-peak hours (9-11am, 2-4pm)** - Minimize customer confusion from mid-session price changes
- ✅ **Before major events** - Pre-plan 4/20, local events, holidays
- ✅ **After creating new rules** - Test new rules on live menu before committing to POS sync

**Avoid publishing:**

- ❌ **During peak hours** - Customers may be mid-checkout when prices change
- ❌ **Without testing first** - Always preview in Analytics tab before publishing
- ❌ **Too frequently** - Constant price changes erode customer trust

<Callout type="warning">
**Important:** Publishing to your BakedBot menu is separate from syncing to your POS system. If you want dynamic pricing in both places, you need to:
1. Publish to Menu (makes prices visible on bakedbot.ai/yourstore)
2. Sync to POS (creates discounts in your Alleaves/Dutchie/Jane system)
</Callout>

### How to Publish Prices

**Step-by-step:**

1. Navigate to **Dashboard → Dynamic Pricing**
2. Click the **"Publish to Menu"** tab
3. Review the summary:
   - Number of active rules
   - Affected products (estimate)
   - Total customer savings
4. Click **"Publish to Menu"** button
5. Wait 10-30 seconds for batch processing
6. Success message shows:
   - Products updated (e.g., "127 products updated")
   - Total savings (e.g., "$1,245.67 in customer savings")
   - Any errors or warnings

**Result:**
Your public menu now shows updated prices with discount badges. Customers see prices like:

```
<strikethrough>$45.00</strikethrough> $31.50  [30% OFF]
```

### Reverting Prices

**Need to undo?** No problem. The "Revert All Prices" button instantly restores all products to their original prices.

**When to revert:**

- 🔧 **Rule malfunction** - Discount applied too aggressively
- 📊 **Negative customer feedback** - Price changes received poorly
- 🎯 **Promotion ended** - Return to standard pricing after sale
- 🧪 **Testing completed** - You were just experimenting

**How to revert:**

1. Go to **Publish to Menu** tab
2. Click **"Revert All Prices"** button
3. Confirm the action (this is irreversible)
4. All products return to original prices immediately
5. Discount badges removed from menu

<Callout type="info">
**Pro tip:** Original prices are automatically preserved when you publish, so reverting is always safe. You never lose the baseline price data.
</Callout>

### Menu Publishing Best Practices

**✅ Do:**

1. **Preview first** - Check Analytics tab to see which products will be affected
2. **Test one rule** - Publish a single high-priority rule first to validate
3. **Publish off-peak** - 9-11am or 2-4pm to minimize customer disruption
4. **Monitor impact** - Check Analytics tab 24 hours after publishing
5. **Communicate changes** - Post on social about new deals/promotions
6. **Revert if needed** - Don't be afraid to undo if something goes wrong

**❌ Don't:**

1. **Publish untested rules** - Always validate logic in Analytics first
2. **Change prices mid-peak** - Customers hate prices changing while they shop
3. **Forget to monitor** - Price changes can impact margins, watch closely
4. **Over-publish** - Constant price changes erode trust (weekly max recommended)
5. **Ignore warnings** - If publish shows errors, investigate before proceeding

### Publishing vs. POS Sync

**Two separate actions:**

| Feature | Publish to Menu | Sync to POS |
|---------|----------------|-------------|
| **Target** | BakedBot public menu | Your POS system (Alleaves/Dutchie/Jane) |
| **Speed** | Instant (10-30 seconds) | 5-15 minutes |
| **Visibility** | Online customers only | In-store + online |
| **Revert** | One-click instant | Manual discount removal in POS |
| **Use case** | Fast online promotions | Permanent price changes |

**When to use both:**

- **Weekend special** - Publish to menu (instant), sync to POS (same prices everywhere)
- **Clearance sale** - Publish to menu (online customers), sync to POS (budtenders see it too)
- **Happy Hour** - Publish to menu only (online exclusive), skip POS sync

**When to use menu publishing only:**

- **Flash sales** - 2-hour promo, publish → promote → revert
- **A/B testing** - Test pricing on online customers before rolling to POS
- **Online exclusives** - Reward web customers with special prices

## Creating Your First Pricing Rule

### Step 1: Choose a Strategy

**4 pricing strategies:**

1. **Clearance** - Move aging inventory before expiration
2. **Competitive** - Match or beat competitor prices
3. **Time-Based** - Happy hour, weekend specials, seasonal promos
4. **Dynamic** - Category-specific or segment-based pricing

### Step 2: Set Conditions

**Condition Types:**

| Condition | When to Use | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Inventory Age** | Clear old stock | Products 45+ days old |
| **Competitor Price** | Stay competitive | When 15%+ above market avg |
| **Time of Day** | Drive off-peak traffic | Weekdays 2-5pm |
| **Day of Week** | Weekend specials | Friday-Sunday |
| **Category** | Promote specific products | All flower products |
| **Stock Level** | Urgent clearance | Less than 5 units |
| **Traffic Level** | Surge pricing | Peak hours (controversial!) |

<Callout type="warning">
**Multiple conditions = AND logic:** All conditions must be met for the rule to apply. Use multiple rules if you need OR logic.
</Callout>

### Step 3: Configure Price Adjustment

**Percentage Discount** (recommended):
- Set discount: 10%, 20%, 30%, etc.
- Min price: Prevent selling below cost ($5.00 minimum)
- Max discount: System enforces 40% maximum

**Fixed Discount**:
- Dollar amount off: $5 off, $10 off, etc.
- Use for specific promotions

### Step 4: Set Priority

**Priority determines rule order (100 = highest):**

- **90-100**: Urgent clearance (expiring soon)
- **70-89**: Competitor matching (market-driven)
- **50-69**: Time-based promotions (happy hour, weekends)
- **20-49**: Category deals (ongoing)
- **1-19**: Default discounts (loyalty, new customers)

**Why priority matters:**
Only the **highest priority matching rule** applies to each product. If multiple rules match, the one with the highest priority wins.

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do This

1. **Start conservative** - Test with 10-15% discounts before going aggressive
2. **Monitor analytics** - Check revenue impact weekly, adjust priorities
3. **Use inventory age rules first** - Clearance prevents losses from expiration
4. **Set minimum prices** - Protect margins with min price floors
5. **Test one rule at a time** - Easier to measure impact
6. **Enable competitor rules when Ezal data is live** - Requires competitor scraping
7. **Review top performers** - Focus on rules generating revenue, disable underperformers

### ❌ Avoid This

1. **Too many active rules** - Limit to 5-7 active rules to start
2. **Overlapping priorities** - Ensure clear priority hierarchy
3. **No minimum prices** - Always set min price to prevent selling below cost
4. **Ignoring analytics** - Rules don't optimize themselves, review weekly
5. **Surge pricing** - Customers hate dynamic price increases, use sparingly
6. **Copying competitors blindly** - Match prices strategically, not automatically
7. **Setting and forgetting** - Market changes, adjust rules quarterly

## Ezal Competitor Intelligence

**What is Ezal?**
Ezal is BakedBot's competitive intelligence agent that scrapes competitor dispensary menus and tracks pricing.

### Enabling Competitor Data

1. Contact support to enable Ezal for your market
2. Provide list of competitor dispensaries to track
3. Wait 24-48 hours for initial data scraping
4. Competitor prices appear in Intelligence tab
5. Enable competitive pricing rules

### Competitor Price Conditions

**Above market:**
```
Competitor Price: above 15%
```
Apply discount when your price is 15%+ higher than competitor average.

**Below market:**
```
Competitor Price: below 10%
```
Reduce discount when your price is already 10%+ lower (maintain margin).

### Competitor Alerts

**Intelligence tab shows:**
- Products where you're 15%+ above market (losing sales)
- Products where you're 15%+ below market (low margins)
- Competitor count and price ranges
- Data freshness (last updated timestamp)

---

## POS Integration (Alleaves)

**How it works:**

1. **Inventory Age Tracking**
   - System reads batch procurement dates from Alleaves
   - Calculates days in inventory automatically
   - Triggers clearance rules when thresholds met

2. **Automatic Discount Creation**
   - When rule applies, discount syncs to Alleaves POS
   - Customer sees discounted price at checkout
   - Sale badge appears on digital menu

3. **Real-time Sync**
   - Price updates within 5 minutes (caching)
   - Discount activates/deactivates based on conditions
   - Analytics track POS discount usage

**Alleaves Requirements:**
- Batch tracking enabled (for inventory age)
- API access configured
- Location ID set in integration settings

---

## Safety & Constraints

**Built-in protections:**

### 40% Maximum Discount
System enforces 40% max discount to prevent margin erosion. Even if you set 60% off, it will cap at 40%.

### Minimum Price Enforcement
Products will never sell below your configured minimum price (recommended: $5.00).

### Single Rule Application
Only **one rule** applies per product (highest priority). No stacking discounts.

### Cache & Performance
5-minute caching on inventory and competitor data prevents excessive API calls.

## Analytics & Optimization

### Key Metrics to Watch

1. **Revenue Impact** (line chart)
   - Daily revenue from dynamic pricing
   - Compare to baseline (static pricing period)
   - Goal: +15-20% uplift

2. **Rule Applications** (bar chart)
   - How often each rule triggers
   - Peak application days/hours
   - Identify underutilized rules

3. **Top Performing Rules** (ranking)
   - Revenue generated per rule
   - Average discount percentage
   - Times applied

4. **Competitor Price Gaps** (alerts)
   - Products significantly above/below market
   - Opportunity to adjust pricing
   - Win back lost customers

### Optimization Cycle

**Weekly review:**
1. Check Analytics tab (Monday mornings)
2. Identify top 3 revenue-generating rules
3. Increase priority or discount on winners
4. Disable rules with negative impact
5. Test one new rule per week

**Monthly deep dive:**
1. Export analytics data (via API)
2. Calculate margin impact (revenue vs. profit)
3. Adjust minimum prices if needed
4. Review competitor landscape (Ezal)
5. Plan next month's promotional calendar

## Troubleshooting

### Rule Not Applying

**Check:**
- ✅ Rule is active (toggle ON)
- ✅ Conditions are met (inventory age threshold, time range)
- ✅ Priority is high enough (not overridden by another rule)
- ✅ Product matches conditions (category, stock level)
- ✅ Min price not blocking discount (product price > min price)

### Discount Not Syncing to POS

**Fix:**
- Verify Alleaves integration active
- Check API credentials valid
- Review integration logs (Settings → Integrations)
- Contact support if persistent

### Competitor Data Missing

**Reasons:**
- Ezal not enabled for your market (contact support)
- Competitor menus not scraped yet (24-48hr initial)
- Product name mismatch (fuzzy matching may fail)
- Data freshness (check last updated timestamp)

### Price Too Low / Too High

**Adjust:**
- Increase minimum price (Rules tab → Edit → Min Price)
- Lower discount percentage (30% → 20%)
- Adjust priority (prevent aggressive clearance from always winning)

## FAQ

**Q: Can I stack multiple discounts?**
A: No, only one rule applies per product (highest priority). Create a single rule with combined discount if needed.

**Q: Will surge pricing upset customers?**
A: Yes, probably. Use surge pricing (negative discounts) very carefully. Customers dislike paying more during peak hours.

**Q: How often does pricing update?**
A: Real-time for rule changes, 5-minute cache for inventory/competitor data, instant sync to POS.

**Q: Can I override a rule for specific products?**
A: Yes, use product ID conditions or disable the rule temporarily. Manual POS discounts override dynamic pricing.

**Q: Do I need Ezal for dynamic pricing?**
A: No, Ezal is only required for competitor price matching rules. Time-based, clearance, and category rules work without it.

**Q: What if I don't have Alleaves POS?**
A: Dynamic pricing requires POS integration for inventory age tracking. We support Alleaves, Dutchie, and Jane. Contact support for other systems.
