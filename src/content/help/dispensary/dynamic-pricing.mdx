# Dynamic Pricing Dashboard

Maximize revenue and move inventory faster with intelligent, rule-based dynamic pricing. BakedBot's pricing engine integrates with your POS system and competitor intelligence to automatically adjust prices based on inventory age, market conditions, time of day, and more.

## Why Dynamic Pricing Works

**Data-driven pricing increases profitability:**
- 💰 **+12-18% revenue** (vs. static pricing)
- 🔄 **40% faster inventory turnover** (clear aging stock)
- 🎯 **Stay competitive** (match market prices automatically)
- ⚡ **React in real-time** (demand-based adjustments)
- 📊 **Optimize margins** (balance volume vs. profit)

<Callout type="success">
**Real example:** A dispensary using dynamic pricing cleared 45+ day inventory 3x faster while maintaining margins, resulting in $23K additional revenue in the first quarter.
</Callout>

## Dashboard Overview

The Dynamic Pricing dashboard has **3 tabs:**

### 1. Rules Tab
Create and manage pricing rules with conditions and priorities.

**Key features:**
- Priority-based rule system (higher priority = applied first)
- Multiple condition types (inventory age, competitor price, time, category)
- Percentage or fixed discounts
- Active/inactive toggle
- Real-time rule testing

### 2. Intelligence Tab
Monitor inventory health and clearance recommendations.

**What you see:**
- **Expiring Soon**: Products approaching expiration (30-60 days)
- **Clearance Candidates**: Aging inventory (45+ days old)
- **Stock Alerts**: Low stock warnings
- **Sale Badges**: Current POS discounts and promotional prices

### 3. Analytics Tab
Track rule performance and revenue impact.

**Metrics:**
- Revenue impact over time (line chart)
- Rule applications per day (bar chart)
- Top performing rules (ranked by revenue)
- Competitor price gaps (alerts when you're 15%+ above/below market)
- Rule application distribution (pie chart)

## Creating Your First Pricing Rule

### Step 1: Choose a Strategy

**4 pricing strategies:**

1. **Clearance** - Move aging inventory before expiration
2. **Competitive** - Match or beat competitor prices
3. **Time-Based** - Happy hour, weekend specials, seasonal promos
4. **Dynamic** - Category-specific or segment-based pricing

### Step 2: Set Conditions

**Condition Types:**

| Condition | When to Use | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Inventory Age** | Clear old stock | Products 45+ days old |
| **Competitor Price** | Stay competitive | When 15%+ above market avg |
| **Time of Day** | Drive off-peak traffic | Weekdays 2-5pm |
| **Day of Week** | Weekend specials | Friday-Sunday |
| **Category** | Promote specific products | All flower products |
| **Stock Level** | Urgent clearance | Less than 5 units |
| **Traffic Level** | Surge pricing | Peak hours (controversial!) |

<Callout type="warning">
**Multiple conditions = AND logic:** All conditions must be met for the rule to apply. Use multiple rules if you need OR logic.
</Callout>

### Step 3: Configure Price Adjustment

**Percentage Discount** (recommended):
- Set discount: 10%, 20%, 30%, etc.
- Min price: Prevent selling below cost ($5.00 minimum)
- Max discount: System enforces 40% maximum

**Fixed Discount**:
- Dollar amount off: $5 off, $10 off, etc.
- Use for specific promotions

### Step 4: Set Priority

**Priority determines rule order (100 = highest):**

- **90-100**: Urgent clearance (expiring soon)
- **70-89**: Competitor matching (market-driven)
- **50-69**: Time-based promotions (happy hour, weekends)
- **20-49**: Category deals (ongoing)
- **1-19**: Default discounts (loyalty, new customers)

**Why priority matters:**
Only the **highest priority matching rule** applies to each product. If multiple rules match, the one with the highest priority wins.

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do This

1. **Start conservative** - Test with 10-15% discounts before going aggressive
2. **Monitor analytics** - Check revenue impact weekly, adjust priorities
3. **Use inventory age rules first** - Clearance prevents losses from expiration
4. **Set minimum prices** - Protect margins with min price floors
5. **Test one rule at a time** - Easier to measure impact
6. **Enable competitor rules when Ezal data is live** - Requires competitor scraping
7. **Review top performers** - Focus on rules generating revenue, disable underperformers

### ❌ Avoid This

1. **Too many active rules** - Limit to 5-7 active rules to start
2. **Overlapping priorities** - Ensure clear priority hierarchy
3. **No minimum prices** - Always set min price to prevent selling below cost
4. **Ignoring analytics** - Rules don't optimize themselves, review weekly
5. **Surge pricing** - Customers hate dynamic price increases, use sparingly
6. **Copying competitors blindly** - Match prices strategically, not automatically
7. **Setting and forgetting** - Market changes, adjust rules quarterly

## Ezal Competitor Intelligence

**What is Ezal?**
Ezal is BakedBot's competitive intelligence agent that scrapes competitor dispensary menus and tracks pricing.

### Enabling Competitor Data

1. Contact support to enable Ezal for your market
2. Provide list of competitor dispensaries to track
3. Wait 24-48 hours for initial data scraping
4. Competitor prices appear in Intelligence tab
5. Enable competitive pricing rules

### Competitor Price Conditions

**Above market:**
```
Competitor Price: above 15%
```
Apply discount when your price is 15%+ higher than competitor average.

**Below market:**
```
Competitor Price: below 10%
```
Reduce discount when your price is already 10%+ lower (maintain margin).

### Competitor Alerts

**Intelligence tab shows:**
- Products where you're 15%+ above market (losing sales)
- Products where you're 15%+ below market (low margins)
- Competitor count and price ranges
- Data freshness (last updated timestamp)

## POS Integration (Alleaves)

**How it works:**

1. **Inventory Age Tracking**
   - System reads batch procurement dates from Alleaves
   - Calculates days in inventory automatically
   - Triggers clearance rules when thresholds met

2. **Automatic Discount Creation**
   - When rule applies, discount syncs to Alleaves POS
   - Customer sees discounted price at checkout
   - Sale badge appears on digital menu

3. **Real-time Sync**
   - Price updates within 5 minutes (caching)
   - Discount activates/deactivates based on conditions
   - Analytics track POS discount usage

**Alleaves Requirements:**
- Batch tracking enabled (for inventory age)
- API access configured
- Location ID set in integration settings

---

## Safety & Constraints

**Built-in protections:**

### 40% Maximum Discount
System enforces 40% max discount to prevent margin erosion. Even if you set 60% off, it will cap at 40%.

### Minimum Price Enforcement
Products will never sell below your configured minimum price (recommended: $5.00).

### Single Rule Application
Only **one rule** applies per product (highest priority). No stacking discounts.

### Cache & Performance
5-minute caching on inventory and competitor data prevents excessive API calls.

## Analytics & Optimization

### Key Metrics to Watch

1. **Revenue Impact** (line chart)
   - Daily revenue from dynamic pricing
   - Compare to baseline (static pricing period)
   - Goal: +15-20% uplift

2. **Rule Applications** (bar chart)
   - How often each rule triggers
   - Peak application days/hours
   - Identify underutilized rules

3. **Top Performing Rules** (ranking)
   - Revenue generated per rule
   - Average discount percentage
   - Times applied

4. **Competitor Price Gaps** (alerts)
   - Products significantly above/below market
   - Opportunity to adjust pricing
   - Win back lost customers

### Optimization Cycle

**Weekly review:**
1. Check Analytics tab (Monday mornings)
2. Identify top 3 revenue-generating rules
3. Increase priority or discount on winners
4. Disable rules with negative impact
5. Test one new rule per week

**Monthly deep dive:**
1. Export analytics data (via API)
2. Calculate margin impact (revenue vs. profit)
3. Adjust minimum prices if needed
4. Review competitor landscape (Ezal)
5. Plan next month's promotional calendar

## Troubleshooting

### Rule Not Applying

**Check:**
- ✅ Rule is active (toggle ON)
- ✅ Conditions are met (inventory age threshold, time range)
- ✅ Priority is high enough (not overridden by another rule)
- ✅ Product matches conditions (category, stock level)
- ✅ Min price not blocking discount (product price > min price)

### Discount Not Syncing to POS

**Fix:**
- Verify Alleaves integration active
- Check API credentials valid
- Review integration logs (Settings → Integrations)
- Contact support if persistent

### Competitor Data Missing

**Reasons:**
- Ezal not enabled for your market (contact support)
- Competitor menus not scraped yet (24-48hr initial)
- Product name mismatch (fuzzy matching may fail)
- Data freshness (check last updated timestamp)

### Price Too Low / Too High

**Adjust:**
- Increase minimum price (Rules tab → Edit → Min Price)
- Lower discount percentage (30% → 20%)
- Adjust priority (prevent aggressive clearance from always winning)

## FAQ

**Q: Can I stack multiple discounts?**
A: No, only one rule applies per product (highest priority). Create a single rule with combined discount if needed.

**Q: Will surge pricing upset customers?**
A: Yes, probably. Use surge pricing (negative discounts) very carefully. Customers dislike paying more during peak hours.

**Q: How often does pricing update?**
A: Real-time for rule changes, 5-minute cache for inventory/competitor data, instant sync to POS.

**Q: Can I override a rule for specific products?**
A: Yes, use product ID conditions or disable the rule temporarily. Manual POS discounts override dynamic pricing.

**Q: Do I need Ezal for dynamic pricing?**
A: No, Ezal is only required for competitor price matching rules. Time-based, clearance, and category rules work without it.

**Q: What if I don't have Alleaves POS?**
A: Dynamic pricing requires POS integration for inventory age tracking. We support Alleaves, Dutchie, and Jane. Contact support for other systems.
