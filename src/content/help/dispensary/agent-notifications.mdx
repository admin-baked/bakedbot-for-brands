# Agent Notifications

Stay ahead of your business with proactive AI-powered alerts. BakedBot's agents continuously monitor your dispensary operations and push real-time notifications when they detect events that need your attention — so you never miss a beat.

## How Agent Notifications Work

Traditional dashboards require you to log in and check metrics manually. BakedBot flips this model: **agents push notifications to you** when something important happens. Each agent monitors its domain and surfaces alerts based on priority, so you only see what matters.

<Callout type="info">
**Think of it like a team of managers running your dispensary 24/7.** Craig watches your campaigns, Money Mike tracks pricing, Deebo monitors compliance, and Mrs. Parker keeps an eye on your customers. When any of them spots something, they tap you on the shoulder.
</Callout>

## What Triggers Notifications

Agents detect and alert you about ten categories of events:

| Category | Examples | Typical Agent |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| **Campaign Results** | Sent confirmations, high open rates, delivery issues | Craig |
| **Pricing Anomalies** | Competitor price drops, margin threshold breaches | Money Mike |
| **CRM Alerts** | VIP customer at risk, upcoming birthdays | Mrs. Parker |
| **Compliance Flags** | Content violations detected, review required | Deebo |
| **Inventory Alerts** | Low stock warnings, expiring batches | System |
| **Competitive Intel** | New competitor detected, product launches | Ezal |
| **System Alerts** | Deployment issues, error rate spikes | System |
| **Approval Requests** | Campaigns pending review, content sign-off | Craig / Deebo |
| **Task Completions** | Playbook steps finished, automations complete | Various |
| **Insights** | Trend analysis, strategic recommendations | Various |

## The Notification Bell

### Where to Find It

The notification bell icon is located in the **dashboard header**, top-right area, and is visible on every dashboard page regardless of your role.

**What you see:**

- **Bell icon** — Always visible in the header
- **Red badge** — Shows unread notification count (e.g., "3")
- **No badge** — All notifications are read or dismissed

### Interacting with the Bell

- **Click** the bell to open the notification panel
- The red badge disappears once you open the panel (notifications marked as read)
- The bell is available on all dashboard pages: Inbox, Analytics, Dynamic Pricing, Loyalty, and more

<Callout type="tip">
**Quick glance:** The red badge count gives you an instant read on pending items. If you see a high number, open the panel right away — there may be urgent items requiring action.
</Callout>

## Notification Panel

### Layout and Navigation

Clicking the bell opens a **slide-out panel** from the header. Notifications are organized chronologically in three groups:

- **Today** — Notifications from the current day
- **Yesterday** — Notifications from the previous day
- **Earlier** — All older notifications

### Anatomy of a Notification

Each notification card displays:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Agent avatar** | Emoji and name identifying the source agent |
| **Title** | Brief summary of the event |
| **Message** | Detailed description with relevant data |
| **Timestamp** | Relative time (e.g., "5 minutes ago", "2 hours ago") |
| **Priority bar** | Color-coded left border indicating urgency |
| **Action button** | Contextual link (e.g., "View Campaign", "Review Compliance") |

**Agent avatars you will see:**

```
Craig        — Marketing campaigns, content, approvals
Money Mike   — Pricing anomalies, margins, competitor prices
Deebo        — Compliance violations, content reviews
Mrs. Parker  — Customer churn risk, birthdays, loyalty milestones
Ezal         — Competitive intelligence, new competitors
System       — Health alerts, cron results, deployments
```

### Priority Color Bars

Every notification has a colored left border indicating its urgency level:

| Priority | Color | Meaning |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **Low** | Gray | Informational — review at your convenience |
| **Medium** | Blue | Notable event — review within a few hours |
| **High** | Orange | Important — review soon, may need action |
| **Urgent** | Red | Critical — requires immediate attention |

### Panel Actions

- **Mark all read** — Button at the top of the panel; clears all unread indicators at once
- **Dismiss (X)** — Click the X on any individual notification to dismiss it permanently
- **Action button** — Click to navigate directly to the relevant page (e.g., campaign details, compliance review, customer profile)

<Callout type="tip">
**Keyboard shortcut:** When the panel is open, press `Escape` to close it without losing your place on the current page.
</Callout>

---

## Multi-Channel Delivery

Notifications are not limited to the dashboard. Based on priority level, alerts are delivered across multiple channels so you never miss critical events — even when you are away from the dashboard.

### Channel Matrix

| Priority | Dashboard | Email | SMS | Push |
|----------|-----------|-------|-----|------|
| **Low** | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Medium** | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| **High** | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |
| **Urgent** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |

### How Each Channel Works

**Dashboard (all priorities):**
- Instant delivery to notification panel
- Persists until read or dismissed
- Action buttons link to relevant pages

**Email (medium and above):**
- Sent to your account email address
- Includes full notification details and action link
- Respects quiet hours settings

**SMS (urgent only):**
- Short message with key details
- Sent to the phone number in your profile
- Only fires for truly critical events (compliance violations, system outages)

**Push notifications (high and above):**
- Browser push notifications when supported
- Works even when BakedBot tab is not active
- Requires one-time browser permission

<Callout type="warning">
**SMS charges may apply.** Urgent SMS notifications are sent via your configured SMS provider (Blackleaf). Ensure your SMS plan includes sufficient credits for notification volume. Most dispensaries see fewer than 5 urgent notifications per month.
</Callout>

## Managing Notifications

### Reading and Dismissing

**Mark as read:**
- Click any notification to mark it as read (removes bold styling)
- Use "Mark all read" button at the top of the panel to clear all unread indicators

**Dismiss:**
- Click the X icon on any notification to dismiss it
- Dismissed notifications are hidden from the panel but retained in storage for 30 days

**Navigate:**
- Click the action button (e.g., "View Campaign", "Review Compliance") to go directly to the relevant page
- The notification is automatically marked as read when you navigate

### Linked Inbox Threads

Some notifications link back to **Inbox threads** for full context. When an agent creates a notification from an ongoing conversation or workflow, you will see a "View Thread" link that opens the relevant inbox thread with complete history.

<Callout type="info">
**Inbox integration:** If you use the Unified Inbox (toggle available in Dashboard > Inbox), agent notifications appear as thread items alongside your regular agent conversations. This gives you a single view of all agent activity.
</Callout>

### Notification Statuses

Every notification has one of four statuses:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Unread** | New notification, not yet viewed |
| **Read** | Viewed but no action taken |
| **Dismissed** | Manually removed from panel |
| **Acted On** | User clicked the action button and navigated to the relevant page |

---

## Notification Settings

### Accessing Settings

Navigate to **Dashboard > Settings > Notifications** to configure your notification preferences.

### Active Hours

Set the hours during which you want to receive notifications:

```
Active Hours: 9:00 AM - 6:00 PM
Time Zone: Eastern (auto-detected)
```

Notifications generated outside active hours are **queued** and delivered when your active hours begin — except for urgent notifications, which always deliver immediately.

### Quiet Hours

Enable quiet hours to suppress non-urgent notifications during specific periods:

```
Quiet Hours: 10:00 PM - 7:00 AM
Suppress: Low, Medium, High
Always deliver: Urgent
```

<Callout type="tip">
**Weekend quiet hours:** You can configure separate quiet hours for weekends. Many dispensary owners set broader quiet hours on Sundays (e.g., all day) while keeping weekday hours tight.
</Callout>

### Channel Preferences

Customize which channels deliver each notification type:

| Notification Type | Dashboard | Email | SMS |
|-------------------|-----------|-------|-----|
| Campaign results | On | On | Off |
| Pricing anomalies | On | On | Off |
| CRM alerts | On | Off | Off |
| Compliance flags | On | On | On |
| Inventory alerts | On | On | Off |
| Competitive intel | On | Off | Off |
| System alerts | On | On | On |
| Approval requests | On | On | Off |
| Task completions | On | Off | Off |
| Insights | On | Off | Off |

These preferences override the default priority-based channel matrix. For example, you can enable SMS for all compliance notifications regardless of priority level.

### Heartbeat Integration

Notification delivery respects the **heartbeat system's** schedule and configuration. The heartbeat runs role-specific checks at regular intervals:

- **Dispensary role:** Every 15 minutes
- **Brand role:** Every 60 minutes
- **Super user role:** Every 30 minutes

Heartbeat checks that detect issues automatically generate notifications through the same system. Configure heartbeat settings at **Dashboard > Settings > Heartbeat** to control check frequency and which checks are active.

---

## Firestore Storage

Notifications are stored per-user in Firestore at:

```
users/{userId}/agent_notifications/{notificationId}
```

### Notification Document Structure

Each notification document contains:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Unique notification identifier |
| `agentName` | string | Source agent (craig, money_mike, deebo, mrs_parker, ezal, system) |
| `title` | string | Short notification title |
| `message` | string | Detailed notification body |
| `priority` | string | low, medium, high, urgent |
| `status` | string | unread, read, dismissed, acted_on |
| `category` | string | Notification category (campaign, pricing, crm, compliance, etc.) |
| `actionUrl` | string | Optional URL for the action button |
| `actionLabel` | string | Optional label for the action button |
| `threadId` | string | Optional linked inbox thread ID |
| `createdAt` | timestamp | When the notification was created |
| `readAt` | timestamp | When the notification was read (null if unread) |
| `dismissedAt` | timestamp | When the notification was dismissed (null if active) |

### Retention Policy

- **Active notifications:** Retained indefinitely
- **Read notifications:** Retained for 90 days
- **Dismissed notifications:** Retained for 30 days, then automatically cleaned up

## Best Practices

### Do's

- **Check notifications daily** — Even low-priority alerts can surface valuable insights over time
- **Act on compliance flags immediately** — Regulatory violations carry real consequences
- **Configure quiet hours** — Prevent notification fatigue during off-hours
- **Use channel preferences** — Route critical categories (compliance, system) to SMS/email; keep informational ones dashboard-only
- **Review churn risk alerts** — A single outreach to an at-risk VIP can save thousands in lifetime value

### Don'ts

- **Don't ignore high-priority alerts** — Orange and red bars mean something needs your attention now
- **Don't dismiss without reading** — Scan the message before hitting X; you might miss something important
- **Don't over-enable SMS** — Reserve SMS for truly urgent channels; too many texts cause alert fatigue
- **Don't disable compliance notifications** — Deebo's alerts protect your license; keep them active on all channels

<Callout type="tip">
**Pro tip:** Set aside 5 minutes at the start of each day to review yesterday's notifications. This quick habit helps you catch trends early — like a pricing anomaly that has been building for a few days or a VIP customer who is gradually disengaging.

## Troubleshooting

### Not Receiving Notifications

**Check:**
- Notifications are enabled in **Dashboard > Settings > Notifications**
- Active hours include the current time
- Quiet hours are not suppressing the notification priority level
- Browser push permissions are granted (for push notifications)
- Email address is verified in your profile (for email notifications)
- Phone number is set in your profile (for SMS notifications)

### Notification Panel Not Opening

**Fix:**
- Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Clear browser cache and reload
- Check for browser extension conflicts (ad blockers can interfere)
- Try a different browser to isolate the issue

### Too Many Notifications

**Reduce volume:**
- Adjust heartbeat check frequency in **Dashboard > Settings > Heartbeat**
- Disable low-priority notification categories you do not need
- Enable quiet hours for evenings and weekends
- Review which agents are generating the most alerts and adjust their check thresholds

### Email or SMS Not Arriving

**Check:**
- Verify email/phone number in profile settings
- Check spam/junk folder for email notifications
- Confirm SMS provider (Blackleaf) has sufficient credits
- Review channel preferences — the notification type may be set to dashboard-only

## FAQ

**Q: Can I turn off notifications entirely?**
A: You can disable individual notification categories and channels, but the dashboard notification bell always remains active. This ensures you never miss a critical system or compliance alert.

**Q: Do notifications count against my plan limits?**
A: No. Notifications are included with all plan tiers at no additional cost. SMS delivery costs depend on your Blackleaf SMS plan.

**Q: How quickly do notifications arrive after an event?**
A: Dashboard notifications are near real-time (under 10 seconds). Email delivery takes 1-3 minutes. SMS delivery takes 15-60 seconds. Push notifications are near-instant when the browser supports them.

**Q: Can I configure notifications for specific products or customers?**
A: Not yet directly. However, agents like Mrs. Parker automatically track your VIP customers, and Money Mike monitors products matching your pricing rules. Configure those systems to indirectly control which events generate notifications.

**Q: Do notifications work on mobile?**
A: Yes. The dashboard notification panel is fully responsive. Email and SMS channels work on any device. Browser push notifications work on mobile browsers that support the Push API.

**Q: What happens to notifications when I am on vacation?**
A: Notifications queue up and are available when you return. Enable quiet hours for your vacation period to suppress non-urgent channels. Urgent notifications (system outages, compliance violations) will still reach you via SMS and email.
