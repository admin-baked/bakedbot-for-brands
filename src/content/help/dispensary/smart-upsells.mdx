# Smart Upsells - Cannabis Science Product Pairing

Increase average order value with AI-powered product suggestions that use cannabis science to recommend complementary products at every customer touchpoint.

## How Smart Upsells Work

BakedBot's upsell engine analyzes your entire product catalog and uses **cannabis science** to suggest complementary products that genuinely pair well together. Unlike generic "frequently bought together" widgets, our suggestions are rooted in terpene profiles, effect stacking, and the entourage effect.

<Callout type="success">
**Real impact:** Dispensaries using Smart Upsells see an average **+22% increase in order value** when customers add a suggested pairing. The key is value-focused framing - customers feel educated, not pressured.
</Callout>

## Where Upsells Appear

Smart Upsells show up at four customer touchpoints, each optimized for that moment in the shopping journey:

### 1. Product Detail - "Pairs Well With"

When a customer clicks on a product, they see 2-3 complementary suggestions below the effects section.

**What customers see:**
- Product image, name, price
- Pairing reason badge ("Similar Terpenes", "Complementary Effects", "Bundle & Save")
- Quick "Add to Cart" button

**Scoring focus:** Terpene/effect matching (30%) and category complement (15%) are prioritized here since the customer is in discovery mode.

### 2. Cart Sidebar - "Complete Your Order"

After adding items to cart, 1-2 compact suggestions appear between the cart items and the total.

**What customers see:**
- Compact product cards with thumbnails
- Pairing reason and savings text
- One-tap "Add" button

**Scoring focus:** Cross-category suggestions are weighted higher (20%) to introduce customers to new product types.

### 3. Checkout - "Last Chance Deals"

On the checkout details step, 1-2 high-margin quick-adds appear before payment.

**What customers see:**
- Compact cards emphasizing savings
- "Add for just $X more" framing
- One-tap add (updates order total instantly)

**Scoring focus:** Margin contribution (35%) and inventory clearing (25%) are weighted highest - this is where you move high-margin and expiring products.

### 4. Smokey Chatbot

When Smokey recommends a product, he proactively suggests ONE complementary item with cannabis science reasoning.

**What customers see:**
```
Smokey: "Great choice! Blue Dream's limonene terpenes pair
perfectly with our Lemon Haze pre-rolls - save 15% when you
grab both in our Citrus Session bundle. Want me to add it?"
```

**Scoring focus:** Uses default weights with terpene science reasoning. Never pushes more than one suggestion per exchange.

## The Science Behind Pairings

### Terpene Entourage Effect

Our engine uses established terpene pairing rules to create scientifically-backed suggestions:

| Stack | Terpenes | Effect | Example Pairing |
|-------|----------|--------|-----------------|
| **Relaxation** | Myrcene + Linalool | Deep calm | Indica flower + lavender tincture |
| **Energy** | Limonene + Pinene | Uplifting focus | Sativa vape + citrus edible |
| **Pain Relief** | Caryophyllene + Myrcene | Anti-inflammatory | CBD topical + Indica flower |
| **Sleep** | Linalool + Myrcene | Sedating | CBN tincture + Indica edible |
| **Focus** | Pinene + Limonene | Mental clarity | Sativa flower + focus gummies |

### Effect Stacking

Beyond terpenes, the engine matches complementary effects:

- **Relaxed + Sleepy** = Wind-down stack
- **Euphoric + Creative** = Social/creative stack
- **Focused + Energetic** = Productivity stack
- **Pain Relief + Relaxed** = Recovery stack

### Category Complements

Cross-category suggestions introduce customers to new product types:

| If Customer Has... | Suggest... |
|-------------------|------------|
| Flower | Pre-rolls, Accessories |
| Edibles | Tinctures, Flower |
| Vapes | Concentrates, Flower |
| Concentrates | Vapes, Flower |
| Tinctures | Edibles, Topicals |

## How Scoring Works

Each potential upsell product is scored on five dimensions:

| Dimension | Weight | What It Measures |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| **Terpene/Effect Match** | 30% | How well terpene profiles and effects complement each other |
| **Margin Contribution** | 25% | Profitability of the suggested product (prioritizes higher-margin items) |
| **Inventory Priority** | 20% | Stock levels and expiration dates (clears slow-moving/expiring inventory) |
| **Category Complement** | 15% | Whether the suggestion is from a different product category |
| **Price Fit** | 10% | Whether the price is within a reasonable range of the anchor product |

<Callout type="info">
**Placement-specific tuning:** Checkout upsells weight margin at 35% (vs. 25% default) because that's the best moment to promote high-profit items. Cart upsells weight cross-category at 20% to broaden the basket.
</Callout>

## Bundle Integration

When a suggested product is part of an **active bundle** with the customer's current selection, the upsell card highlights the savings:

- **Badge:** "Bundle & Save"
- **Savings text:** "Save 15% in our Sleep Starter Pack"
- **Priority boost:** Bundle matches score higher in the ranking

This creates a natural bridge between your upsell suggestions and your bundle promotions.

## Best Practices

<Callout type="tip">
**Enrich your product data:** The engine's terpene and effect matching is only as good as your product data. Make sure products have:
- **Effects** (Relaxed, Euphoric, Sleepy, etc.)
- **Terpene profiles** (Myrcene, Limonene, Caryophyllene, etc.)
- **THC/CBD percentages**
- **Category** and **strain type**
- **Cost of goods** (enables margin-based scoring)

Products with complete data get better pairing matches and higher-quality suggestions.

### Do's

- **Let science drive the conversation** - Terpene pairings feel educational, not pushy
- **Lead with savings** - "Save $12 when you add this" converts better than "You might also like"
- **Create bundles for top pairings** - If two products frequently pair well, create a bundle with a discount
- **Monitor which upsells convert** - Double down on strategies that work for your customer base
- **Keep inventory updated** - The engine deprioritizes low-stock items automatically

### Don'ts

- **Don't overwhelm customers** - The engine limits suggestions (3 max on product detail, 2 on cart/checkout, 1 in chat)
- **Don't ignore "no thanks"** - Smokey is trained to immediately respect declined suggestions
- **Don't pair unrelated products** - The scoring engine prevents random pairings, but good product data helps
- **Don't discount too aggressively** - Bundle savings are great, but protect your margins (40% max discount enforced)

## Upsell Analytics (Coming Soon)

Phase 4 will add comprehensive upsell tracking:

- **Impression tracking** - Which upsells are being shown
- **Click-through rates** - Which suggestions customers explore
- **Conversion rates** - Which pairings actually get added to cart
- **Revenue attribution** - Revenue directly from upsell suggestions
- **Co-purchase patterns** - Data-driven pairings from real order history (100+ orders needed)

## FAQ

**Q: Do upsells show for all dispensaries?**
A: Currently active for pilot customers (Thrive Syracuse). Rolling out to all dispensaries as we validate conversion rates.

**Q: Can I disable upsells?**
A: Yes - upsells only appear when `orgId` is passed to the menu components. Removing the orgId prop disables them.

**Q: How often does the product catalog refresh?**
A: Every 5 minutes. The engine caches your product catalog and active bundles with a 5-minute TTL.

**Q: Does Smokey push upsells too aggressively?**
A: No. Smokey is instructed to suggest ONE pairing per exchange and immediately respect "no thanks." The tone is educational ("these terpenes work together") not pushy.

**Q: How does it handle out-of-stock products?**
A: Low-stock products are deprioritized by the inventory priority scoring dimension. Products with zero stock are excluded entirely.
