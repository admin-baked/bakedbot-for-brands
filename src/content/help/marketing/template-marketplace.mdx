# Template Marketplace

Browse, install, and share professionally designed website templates for your cannabis business.

## What is the Template Marketplace?

The Template Marketplace is a community-driven library of website templates built with Vibe Builder. Find a template you like, install it with one click, and customize it to match your brand.

**Access:** Visit **bakedbot.ai/vibe/templates** or navigate from the Vibe Builder dashboard.

<Callout type="tip">
**Templates are free** for all BakedBot users. Install as many as you like - each one becomes your own project that you can fully customize.

## Browsing Templates

### Search and Filter

- **Search bar**: Find templates by name or keyword
- **Categories**: E-commerce, Landing Page, Portfolio, Blog, and more
- **Tags**: Cannabis-specific tags like "dispensary", "brand", "wellness"
- **Sort by**: Popularity, Newest, Rating

### Template Cards

Each template shows:
- **Preview thumbnail** - See how it looks

## Installing a Template

1. Find a template you want to use
2. Click **"Use Template"**
3. The template is copied to your Vibe Builder projects
4. Open the project in the visual editor
5. Customize everything - colors, text, images, layout

<Callout type="info">
**Your copy is independent** - changing your installed template doesn't affect the original. The template creator and other users who installed it won't see your changes.
