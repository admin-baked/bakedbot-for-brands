# Custom Domains

Connect your own domain name to BakedBot-hosted content. Use professional URLs like `www.yourdispensary.com` instead of default subdomains.

## What Are Custom Domains?

Custom domains let you serve your BakedBot content (menus, websites, landing pages) from your own branded URL. Instead of `yourbrand.bakedbot.site`, visitors see `www.yourbrand.com`.

**Benefits:**
- Professional, branded web presence
- Better SEO ranking (search engines prefer custom domains)
- Customer trust and recognition
- Multiple domains for different purposes

<Callout type="tip">
**One System, All Content**: BakedBot's unified domain manager lets you point any domain to any content type - product menus, Vibe Builder websites, or both on the same domain.
</Callout>

## Domain Target Types

When you add a custom domain, choose what it serves:

### Product Menu
Point your domain to your BakedBot product catalog.

**Example:** `shop.mydispensary.com` → Your product menu with search, filters, and cart

**Best for:** Dispensaries who want a branded shopping experience

### Vibe Builder Site
Point your domain to a website you built with Vibe Builder.

**Example:** `www.mydispensary.com` → Your marketing website

**Best for:** Full websites, landing pages, campaign pages

### Hybrid (Both)
Serve both your website AND menu on the same domain using path-based routing.

**Example:**
- `mydispensary.com/` → Your Vibe Builder website (homepage, about, etc.)
- `mydispensary.com/shop` → Your product menu

**Best for:** Complete web presence on a single domain

## Setting Up a Custom Domain

### Step 1: Open Domain Manager

Navigate to **Dashboard → Admin → Custom Domains** or click "Custom Domains" in your sidebar.

### Step 2: Add Your Domain

1. Click **"Add Domain"**
2. Enter your domain name (e.g., `www.yourbrand.com`)
3. Select what the domain should serve:
   - **Product Menu** - Your BakedBot catalog
   - **Vibe Builder Site** - Select a published project
   - **Both (Hybrid)** - Website at root, menu at /shop
4. Click **"Add Domain"**

### Step 3: Configure DNS

BakedBot will show you the DNS records to add at your domain registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, Cloudflare, etc.).

**For subdomains** (e.g., `shop.yourbrand.com`):

| Record Type | Host | Value |
|-------------|------|-------|
| CNAME | shop | cname.bakedbot.ai |

**For root domains** (e.g., `yourbrand.com`):

Update your nameservers to:
- `ns1.bakedbot.ai`
- `ns2.bakedbot.ai`

<Callout type="warning">
**DNS changes take time**: After adding DNS records, wait 5-60 minutes for propagation. Some registrars may take up to 24 hours.
</Callout>

### Step 4: Verify

1. Wait for DNS propagation (5-60 minutes)
2. Return to the Domain Manager
3. Click **"Verify DNS"**
4. Once verified, your domain is live!

### Step 5: SSL Certificate

SSL certificates are automatically provisioned after verification. Your site will be accessible via `https://` within minutes of verification.

## Managing Domains

### View All Domains

The Domain Manager shows all your connected domains with:
- **Status badge**: Verified, Pending, or Failed
- **Target type**: Menu, Vibe Site, or Hybrid
- **Connection type**: CNAME or Nameserver

### Change What a Domain Serves

Want to switch a domain from menu to website? You can update the target without re-verifying DNS:

1. Find the domain in your list
2. Click the settings icon
3. Select a new target type
4. Save changes

### Remove a Domain

1. Find the domain in your list
2. Click the trash icon
3. Confirm removal

The domain will stop routing to BakedBot immediately. Don't forget to update your DNS records at your registrar.

## Troubleshooting

### "Verification Pending"
- DNS changes haven't propagated yet
- Wait 15-60 minutes and try again
- Use a DNS checker tool to verify your records are visible

### "Verification Failed"
- Check that DNS records match exactly what BakedBot shows
- Ensure there are no conflicting records (e.g., existing A records)
- Some registrars require removing old records before adding new ones

### Domain Shows Wrong Content
- Verify the target type is set correctly in Domain Manager
- For hybrid domains, check that path routing matches your expectations
- Clear your browser cache and try again
