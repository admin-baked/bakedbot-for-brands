# Campaign Management

Plan, create, and send compliance-checked SMS and email campaigns from a single dashboard. BakedBot's Campaign Management system combines AI content generation (Craig), automated compliance review (Deebo), CRM-based audience segmentation, and real-time performance tracking into one streamlined workflow.

## Campaign Dashboard Overview

Navigate to **Dashboard → Campaigns** to access the Campaign Management hub.

### Stats Row

At the top of the dashboard, four KPI cards give you an instant pulse on your marketing:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Total Campaigns** | Lifetime count of all campaigns created |
| **Active** | Campaigns currently sending or scheduled |
| **Sent This Month** | Number of campaigns that completed sending in the current calendar month |
| **Avg Open Rate** | Weighted average open rate across all campaigns sent this month |

### Campaign Tabs

Filter your campaign list by status:

| Tab | Shows |
|-----|-------|
| **All** | Every campaign regardless of status |
| **Active** | Campaigns currently sending or in compliance review |
| **Scheduled** | Approved campaigns waiting for their scheduled send time |
| **Drafts** | Campaigns saved but not yet submitted for review |
| **Completed** | Campaigns that have finished sending |

Each campaign appears as a card showing:
- Campaign name and status badge
- Channels (Email, SMS, or both)
- Target audience segments
- Key performance metrics (if sent)
- Quick-action buttons

<Callout type="tip">
**Quick filter**: Click any status badge in the stats row to jump directly to that tab. For example, clicking the "Active" count filters to active campaigns instantly.
</Callout>

## Campaign Lifecycle

Every campaign moves through a defined status flow from creation to completion:

```
draft → compliance_review → pending_approval → approved → scheduled → sending → sent
```

**Additional statuses:**
- **paused** — Campaign manually paused mid-send or while scheduled
- **cancelled** — Campaign cancelled before completion
- **failed** — Campaign encountered a sending error (check logs for details)

| Status | What Happens | Who Acts |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| `draft` | Campaign created, content being written | You |
| `compliance_review` | Deebo checking content for violations | Deebo (automatic) |
| `pending_approval` | Compliance passed, awaiting your approval | You |
| `approved` | You approved, ready to schedule or send | You |
| `scheduled` | Queued for future send time | System (cron) |
| `sending` | Actively delivering to recipients | System |
| `sent` | All messages delivered, tracking active | Complete |

<Callout type="info">
**Automated sending**: A cron job runs every 5 minutes, picking up campaigns where `status = scheduled` and `scheduledAt <= now`. Once triggered, the system sends via the configured channels, logs each communication, and updates performance metrics in real time.
</Callout>

## Creating a Campaign — The 4-Step Wizard

Click the **"New Campaign"** button on the dashboard to open the campaign wizard dialog. The wizard walks you through four steps: Goal, Audience, Content, and Review.

---

### Step 1: Goal

Choose the primary objective for your campaign. The goal you select determines the default content templates and suggested audience segments Craig will offer.

| Goal | Best For | Suggested Segments |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| **Drive Sales** | Product promotions, flash sales, discount codes | All, VIP, Frequent |
| **Win-Back** | Re-engage lapsed customers | At Risk, Slipping, Churned |
| **Retention** | Keep loyal customers engaged | Loyal, VIP, Frequent |
| **Loyalty** | Reward high-value customers | VIP, High Value |
| **Birthday** | Automated birthday offers | Birthday segment (auto) |
| **Restock Alert** | "Your favorites are back in stock" | Previous purchasers |
| **VIP Appreciation** | Exclusive offers for top spenders | VIP, High Value |
| **Product Launch** | New product announcements | All, VIP (early access) |
| **Event Promo** | Dispensary events, vendor days | All, Local |
| **Awareness** | Brand building, educational content | All, New |

**Example goals in practice:**

- **Drive Sales**: "20% off all flower this weekend" — targets active customers with a promotion
- **Win-Back**: "We miss you! Here's 25% off your next visit" — targets customers who have not purchased in 60+ days
- **Birthday**: "Happy birthday! Enjoy a free pre-roll on us" — automatically sent on the customer's birthday

<Callout type="tip">
**Choose the right goal first.** Craig uses your goal to generate more relevant content. A "Win-Back" goal produces empathetic, incentive-focused copy, while a "Product Launch" goal produces excitement-driven, feature-focused copy.
</Callout>

---

### Step 2: Audience

Select one or more CRM segments to target. Each segment shows an estimated reach count so you know how many recipients will receive the campaign.

**Available segments:**

| Segment | Definition | Typical Size |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| **VIP** | Top 10% by lifetime spend | Small, high-value |
| **Loyal** | 5+ purchases, active in last 60 days | Medium |
| **New** | First purchase within last 30 days | Varies |
| **At Risk** | No purchase in 30-60 days, previously active | Medium |
| **Slipping** | No purchase in 60-90 days | Medium |
| **Churned** | No purchase in 90+ days | Large |
| **High Value** | Average order value in top 20% | Small-medium |
| **Frequent** | 3+ purchases per month | Small |

**Multi-select is supported.** Combine segments for broader reach:
- "VIP + Loyal" for your best customers
- "At Risk + Slipping" for a re-engagement push
- "New" alone for onboarding campaigns

The estimated reach count updates in real time as you add or remove segments.

<Callout type="warning">
**Audience overlap**: When selecting multiple segments, the system automatically deduplicates. A customer who appears in both "VIP" and "Loyal" receives the campaign only once.
</Callout>

---

### Step 3: Content

The content editor lets you write (or generate) messaging for each channel. Select one or both channels: **Email** and **SMS**.

#### Email Content

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Subject Line** | The email subject (keep under 50 characters for best open rates) |
| **Body** | Rich text body with formatting |
| **HTML** | Optional raw HTML for custom templates |

#### SMS Content

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Body** | Plain text message (target 160 characters or fewer) |
| **Image** | Optional MMS image attachment |

#### "Generate with Craig" — AI Content Creation

Click the **"Generate with Craig"** button to have Craig draft content for you. Craig uses your selected goal, audience segments, and brand context to produce channel-specific copy.

**How it works:**
1. Click "Generate with Craig"
2. Craig creates an inbox thread with a draft for each channel
3. Review the generated content in the editor
4. Edit as needed, or click "Generate" again for a new variation

**Example prompt to Craig:**
```
"Write a win-back campaign for at-risk customers.
Offer 25% off their next order. Mention our new
edibles line. Keep the SMS under 160 characters."
```

**Craig generates:**

**Email:**
```
Subject: We saved something special for you

Hi {{firstName}},

It's been a while since your last visit, and we've
been busy stocking up on new favorites we think
you'll love.

Our new edibles line just dropped — gummies, mints,
and chocolates in flavors you won't find anywhere
else.

As a thank you for being part of the family, here's
25% off your next order.

Use code: WELCOME25
Expires: [date]

Shop Now →

See you soon,
[Your Brand]
```

**SMS:**
```
{{firstName}}, we miss you! 25% off your next order
with code WELCOME25. New edibles just dropped.
Shop: [link] Reply STOP to opt out
```

#### Personalization Variables

Insert dynamic customer data into your content using double-curly-brace variables:

| Variable | Inserts | Example Output |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| `{{firstName}}` | Customer's first name | "Sarah" |
| `{{lastName}}` | Customer's last name | "Johnson" |
| `{{segment}}` | Customer's primary segment | "VIP" |
| `{{totalSpent}}` | Lifetime spend amount | "$2,450.00" |
| `{{orderCount}}` | Total number of orders | "23" |
| `{{lastOrderDate}}` | Date of most recent order | "Jan 15, 2026" |
| `{{loyaltyPoints}}` | Current loyalty point balance | "1,250" |
| `{{loyaltyTier}}` | Current loyalty tier name | "Gold" |

**Usage example:**
```
Hi {{firstName}}, as a {{loyaltyTier}} member with
{{loyaltyPoints}} points, you've earned early access
to our spring collection!
```

<Callout type="tip">
**Fallback values**: If a personalization variable is missing for a customer (e.g., no loyalty tier), the system uses a sensible default. `{{firstName}}` falls back to "there" (as in "Hi there"), and numeric fields fall back to "0".
</Callout>

---

### Step 4: Review

The final step shows a complete summary of your campaign with compliance results, audience details, and send options.

#### Compliance Check (Deebo Integration)

When you reach Step 4, Deebo automatically reviews your content for cannabis marketing compliance. Each channel's content is checked separately.

**Deebo checks for:**
- No medical claims ("cures", "treats", "heals", "therapeutic")
- No language targeting or appealing to minors
- Required disclaimers present (age verification, opt-out instructions)
- Age-appropriate imagery (no cartoons, no youth-oriented visuals)
- State-specific regulatory compliance
- Truthful advertising (no misleading claims)

**Compliance results appear inline:**

| Status | Meaning | Action Required |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| **Passed** (green) | Content meets all compliance requirements | None — ready to send |
| **Warning** (yellow) | Suggestions for improvement, not blocking | Review suggestions, fix if desired |
| **Failed** (red) | Violations found, cannot send until fixed | Fix violations listed, re-submit |

**Example violation:**
```
FAILED: Email body contains medical claim
Line: "Our CBD gummies treat anxiety and insomnia"
Fix: Replace with "Our CBD gummies are crafted for
     relaxation and calm"
```

**Example warning:**
```
WARNING: SMS missing brand name
Suggestion: Include your dispensary name in the
message for brand recognition and compliance
```

<Callout type="warning">
**Compliance is mandatory.** Campaigns with a "Failed" compliance status cannot be scheduled or sent. Fix all red violations before proceeding. Yellow warnings are recommendations and do not block sending.
</Callout>

#### Schedule or Send

After passing compliance review, choose when to send:

- **Send Now**: Begins sending immediately after you confirm
- **Schedule**: Pick a specific date and time for future delivery

For scheduled campaigns, the cron-based sender picks up the campaign at the scheduled time (checked every 5 minutes) and begins delivery automatically.

## Channels

### Email (Mailjet / SendGrid)

BakedBot sends email campaigns through Mailjet or SendGrid, depending on your integration configuration.

**Features:**
- HTML and rich-text templates
- Open tracking via 1x1 pixel
- Click tracking via redirect URLs
- Bounce handling and list hygiene
- Unsubscribe link management

**Setup:** Configure your email provider in **Dashboard → Settings → Integrations**.

### SMS (Blackleaf)

</Callout>

## Agent Integration — Campaigns from Chat

One of the most powerful features of BakedBot campaigns is the ability to create and manage them directly from the inbox chat interface, using Craig and Mrs. Parker.

### Creating Campaigns via Chat

Open your inbox and talk to Craig:

```
You: "Plan a win-back campaign for at-risk customers
      with 20% off and mention our new edibles"

Craig: "I've drafted a win-back campaign targeting
        your At Risk and Slipping segments (estimated
        reach: 342 customers). Here's what I have..."
```

Craig creates an inline campaign card right in the chat showing:
- Campaign name and status
- Selected channels (Email, SMS)
- Target audience and reach
- Content preview

### Inline Campaign Cards

When Craig creates or references a campaign, an interactive card appears in the chat thread:

**Campaign Card shows:**
- Campaign name
- Status badge (draft, scheduled, sent, etc.)
- Channel icons
- Audience segments and estimated reach

**Quick actions on cards:**
- **Review** — Open campaign details
- **Approve** — Move from pending_approval to approved
- **Schedule** — Set send date/time
- **View Campaign** — Open the full campaign page

### Performance Cards in Chat

After a campaign sends, ask Craig for results:

```
You: "How did the win-back campaign perform?"

Craig: [Performance card showing:]
       Sent: 342 | Opened: 198 (57.9%) |
       Clicked: 67 (19.6%)
       Revenue attributed: $4,280
```

Performance cards display horizontal bars for sent, opened, and clicked metrics with percentage labels.

<Callout type="tip">
**Ask Mrs. Parker for strategic advice.** While Craig handles campaign execution, Mrs. Parker can analyze campaign performance trends and recommend strategy adjustments: "Mrs. Parker, which campaign goals are performing best this quarter?"
</Callout>

## Performance Tracking

### How Tracking Works

BakedBot tracks campaign performance through:

- **Email opens**: A 1x1 transparent tracking pixel embedded in each email. When the recipient's email client loads the image, an open event is recorded.
- **Email clicks**: All links in campaign emails are wrapped in redirect URLs. When a recipient clicks, the click is logged before redirecting to the destination.
- **SMS delivery**: Blackleaf provides delivery confirmation callbacks for each sent message.
- **Revenue attribution**: When a campaign recipient makes a purchase within the attribution window, the revenue is attributed to the campaign.

### Metrics Tracked

| Metric | Description | How Calculated |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **totalRecipients** | Number of customers targeted | Count of deduplicated segment members |
| **sent** | Messages successfully dispatched | Count from sending provider |
| **delivered** | Messages confirmed delivered | Sent minus bounced |
| **opened** | Recipients who opened the message | Tracking pixel loads (email) |
| **clicked** | Recipients who clicked a link | Redirect URL hits |
| **bounced** | Messages that failed to deliver | Provider bounce callbacks |
| **revenue** | Revenue attributed to this campaign | Purchases within attribution window |

### Computed Rates

| Rate | Formula | Industry Benchmark |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| **Open Rate** | opened / delivered | Email: 20-25%, SMS: 90%+ |
| **Click Rate** | clicked / delivered | Email: 2-5%, SMS: 15-30% |
| **Conversion Rate** | purchases / delivered | 2-5% |
| **Bounce Rate** | bounced / sent | Below 2% (healthy) |

### Campaign Detail Page

Click any campaign card to open the full performance dashboard. This page includes:

1. **Summary bar**: Total recipients, sent count, delivery rate
2. **Engagement funnel**: Visual funnel from sent → delivered → opened → clicked → converted
3. **Revenue card**: Total attributed revenue, average order value, ROI
4. **Timeline chart**: Engagement over time (opens and clicks by hour/day)
5. **Channel breakdown**: Separate performance metrics for Email and SMS

<Callout type="info">
**Real-time updates**: Performance metrics update as tracking events arrive. Email open data may take 24-48 hours to stabilize as recipients open emails at different times.
</Callout>

### ROI Calculation

```
ROI = (Revenue - Cost) / Cost x 100

Example:
  SMS Campaign Cost: $102 (3,400 messages x $0.03)
  Email Campaign Cost: $3.40 (3,400 emails x $0.001)
  Total Cost: $105.40
  Revenue Generated: $4,280
  ROI: ($4,280 - $105.40) / $105.40 x 100 = 3,960% ROI
```

## Campaign Best Practices

### SMS Best Practices

<Callout type="warning">
**SMS Compliance Rules:**
- Always include opt-out language ("Reply STOP to opt out")
- Send only to customers who have opted in
- Never send after 9pm or before 9am local time
- Limit frequency to 4-6 messages per month maximum
- Include your brand/dispensary name in every message
</Callout>

**Content tips:**
- Keep under 160 characters to avoid message splitting
- Front-load the most important information (offer, deadline)
- Use emojis sparingly (1-2 maximum)
- Include a clear CTA with a shortened link
- Personalize with `{{firstName}}` when possible

**Optimal send times:**
- **Best**: Tuesday through Thursday, 10am-2pm or 5pm-7pm
- **Good**: Friday 10am-12pm (weekend planning)
- **Avoid**: Monday mornings, late evenings, weekends

### Email Best Practices

**Subject lines:**
- Keep under 50 characters for full visibility on mobile
- Personalize when possible ("{{firstName}}, your exclusive offer")
- Create urgency or curiosity without being clickbait
- A/B test different approaches to find what resonates

**Content:**
- Design mobile-first (60%+ of opens happen on mobile devices)
- Use a single, prominent CTA button — do not overwhelm with options
- Include product images when promoting specific items
- Add personalization throughout, not just the greeting
- Always include: unsubscribe link, contact info, physical address

**Optimal send times:**
- **Best days**: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
- **Best times**: 10am (morning routine), 2pm (afternoon break), 6pm (after work)
- **Avoid**: Weekend mornings (lowest open rates)

### General Campaign Best Practices

| Practice | Why It Matters |
|----------|---------------|
| **Segment your audience** | Targeted campaigns perform 5-10x better than blasts to everyone |
| **Personalize content** | Emails with personalized subject lines have 26% higher open rates |
| **Always run compliance** | Deebo catches violations before they become legal problems |
| **Test send times** | Your audience may differ from industry averages |
| **Monitor performance** | Check results within 24-48 hours and adjust future campaigns |
| **Respect frequency** | Over-messaging leads to unsubscribes and brand damage |

## Cron-Based Campaign Sending

BakedBot uses a cron-based system to handle campaign delivery reliably at scale.

**How it works:**
1. You schedule a campaign for a specific date and time
2. The campaign sender cron runs every 5 minutes
3. On each run, it queries for campaigns where `status = scheduled` and `scheduledAt <= now`
4. For each qualifying campaign, the system:
   - Updates status to `sending`
   - Iterates through the recipient list
   - Sends via the configured channel(s) (Mailjet/SendGrid for email, Blackleaf for SMS)
   - Logs each communication to the `communications` collection
   - Updates performance metrics in real time
5. When all messages are dispatched, status updates to `sent`
6. An agent notification is sent to the campaign creator confirming completion

<Callout type="info">
**Delivery timing**: Because the cron runs every 5 minutes, your campaign may begin sending up to 5 minutes after the scheduled time. For time-sensitive campaigns (flash sales, event reminders), schedule 5-10 minutes early to ensure delivery by your target time.
</Callout>

## Measuring Campaign Success

### Setting Benchmarks

Use these cannabis industry benchmarks to evaluate your campaign performance:

**Email Benchmarks:**

| Metric | Poor | Average | Good | Excellent |
|--------|------|---------|------|-----------|
| Open Rate | < 15% | 20% | 25% | 30%+ |
| Click Rate | < 1.5% | 3% | 5% | 8%+ |
| Conversion Rate | < 1% | 2% | 4% | 6%+ |
| Bounce Rate | > 5% | 2% | 1% | < 0.5% |
| Unsubscribe Rate | > 1% | 0.5% | 0.2% | < 0.1% |

**SMS Benchmarks:**

| Metric | Poor | Average | Good | Excellent |
|--------|------|---------|------|-----------|
| Delivery Rate | < 90% | 95% | 98% | 99%+ |
| Open Rate | < 85% | 90% | 95% | 98%+ |
| Click Rate | < 10% | 20% | 30% | 40%+ |
| Conversion Rate | < 2% | 5% | 8% | 12%+ |

### Key Questions to Ask

After each campaign, review:

1. **Did we reach the right audience?** Check delivery rate and bounce rate. High bounces indicate list quality issues.
2. **Did the content resonate?** Open rate tells you about subject line effectiveness. Click rate tells you about content quality.
3. **Did we drive action?** Conversion rate and attributed revenue tell you the campaign's actual business impact.
4. **What can we improve?** Compare against benchmarks and your own historical averages.

## Troubleshooting

### Campaign Stuck in "compliance_review"

**Problem:** Campaign submitted but compliance check has not completed.

**Solutions:**
- Wait 2-3 minutes; Deebo processes asynchronously
- Check the inbox for a Deebo thread with compliance results
- If stuck for more than 10 minutes, save as draft and re-submit
- Contact support if the issue persists

### Campaign Stuck in "sending"

**Problem:** Campaign shows "sending" status but recipients have not received messages.

**Solutions:**
- Check your integration status in **Dashboard → Settings → Integrations**
- Verify Mailjet/SendGrid or Blackleaf API keys are valid and not expired
- Check the campaign log for error messages
- If the provider is experiencing an outage, the cron will retry on the next run

### Low Open Rates

**Email (target 20%+):**
- Improve subject lines (A/B test different approaches)
- Clean your email list (remove bounced addresses)
- Check spam score and sender reputation
- Adjust send times based on audience behavior

**SMS (target 90%+):**
- Verify phone numbers are valid and opted in
- Check for carrier filtering issues
- Ensure messages include your brand name
- Avoid spam-trigger words in content

### Low Click Rates

**Email (target 3%+):**
- Use larger, more prominent CTA buttons
- Reduce the number of links (single focused CTA)
- Ensure links work and lead to mobile-friendly pages
- Add compelling reason to click (urgency, exclusivity)

**SMS (target 20%+):**
- Shorten and simplify the message
- Make the offer clearer and more compelling
- Verify the link works on mobile devices
- Test different CTAs

### Low Conversion Rates

**Target: 2-5%:**
- Verify discount codes work at checkout
- Ensure landing pages match campaign messaging
- Increase the incentive (15% to 20%)
- Reduce friction (direct product links, pre-applied discounts)
- Check that the product is in stock

### Compliance Check Failing

**Problem:** Deebo flags violations on content you believe is compliant.

**Solutions:**
- Read the specific violation message carefully
- Remove or rephrase medical claims (even implied ones)
- Add required disclaimers (age verification, opt-out)
- Remove imagery that could appeal to minors
- Review [Compliance Guide](/help/marketing/compliance) for detailed rules
