# Media Budget Management

Control costs for AI-generated images and videos with automated budget tracking, alerts, and spending limits. Never overspend on content creation again.

## Why Budget Management Matters

AI-generated media has real costs:

| Provider | Type | Cost |
|----------|------|------|
| **Gemini Flash** | Image | $0.02/image |
| **Gemini Pro** | Image | $0.04/image |
| **Veo** | Video (4-8s) | $0.50-0.75/video |
| **Sora** | Video (4-8s) | $0.50-1.00/video |

<Callout type="warning">
**Scale adds up fast**: 100 product images at $0.02 = $2.00. 50 videos at $0.75 = $37.50. Daily playbook automations can generate dozens of assets per day.
</Callout>

Without budget controls, automated playbooks and agent-generated content can exceed expected costs. Budget management prevents surprises.

## Setting Up Your Budget

### Step 1: Access Media Dashboard

1. Go to **Dashboard → Media Center**
2. Click **"Budget Settings"** tab
3. View current spending and configure limits

### Step 2: Configure Budget Limits

Set three levels of protection:

**Daily Limit**
Maximum spend per day (resets at midnight)
- Recommended: $10-25 for active brands
- Use for: Controlling playbook costs

**Weekly Limit**
Maximum spend per week (resets Monday)
- Recommended: $50-100 for regular campaigns
- Use for: Campaign budget allocation

**Monthly Limit**
Maximum spend per month (resets 1st)
- Recommended: $200-500 for full automation
- Use for: Overall budget planning

<Callout type="tip">
**Start conservative**: Set daily at $10, weekly at $50, monthly at $200. Increase as you understand usage patterns.
</Callout>

### Step 3: Configure Alert Thresholds

Get notified before hitting limits:

**Soft Limit (default 80%)**
Warning when approaching budget
- Dashboard notification
- Email alert to admin
- Does NOT block generation

**Hard Limit (100%)**
Blocks all media generation when reached
- Dashboard alert (red)
- Email to admin
- Requires manual override or next period

**Example Configuration:**
```
Daily Budget: $20
Soft Limit: 80% ($16)
Hard Limit: 100% ($20)

At $16 spent → Warning notification
At $20 spent → All generation blocked until tomorrow
```

## Monitoring Spending

### Cost Dashboard

The Media Dashboard shows:

**Summary Cards:**
- Total cost (current period)
- Generations count
- Success rate
- Average cost per generation

**Provider Breakdown:**
```
Gemini Flash: $12.40 (620 images)
Gemini Pro:    $8.00 (200 images)
Veo:          $45.00 (60 videos)
Sora:         $12.50 (15 videos)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Total:        $77.90 (895 assets)
```

**Daily Trend Chart:**
Visual graph showing cost and volume over time

**Budget Status:**
- Green: Under 60%
- Yellow: 60-80% (approaching soft limit)
- Orange: 80-100% (soft limit exceeded)
- Red: 100%+ (hard limit hit, generation blocked)

### Real-Time Alerts

Budget alerts appear in:

1. **Dashboard Badge** - Red notification dot
2. **Email** - Sent to account admin
3. **Agent Chat** - Warning in conversation
4. **API Response** - Error when generation attempted

<Callout type="info">
**Alerts sent at**: 50%, 80%, 90%, 100% of budget. You'll have multiple warnings before generation stops.
</Callout>

## Cost Optimization Tips

### 1. Use Appropriate Tiers

Match provider to use case:

| Use Case | Provider | Cost | Best For |
|----------|----------|------|----------|
| Social thumbnails | Gemini Flash | $0.02 | High volume, quick iterations |
| Product hero images | Gemini Pro | $0.04 | Marketing materials, hero shots |
| Social clips (short) | Veo | $0.50 | Instagram Reels, TikTok |
| Premium video ads | Sora | $1.00 | Polished commercials |

**Cost Savings:**
Use Flash for thumbnails → Pro for finals → Save 50%

### 2. Leverage Style Presets

Reuse successful styles instead of experimenting:
- Test 5 styles → Pick winner → Reuse
- Saves regeneration costs
- Maintains brand consistency

### 3. Schedule Smart Generations

Avoid redundant daily generations:
- Weekly deals video: Monday only (not daily)
- Product spotlight: 3x/week (not 7x)
- Social content: Batch 5 posts/session

### 4. Use A/B Testing Strategically

Test 2-3 variants (not 10):
- More variants = higher cost
- Diminishing returns after 3
- Statistical significance with 2-3

### 5. Monitor Success Rate

Failed generations still cost money:
- Check prompt quality
- Review error logs
- Improve prompts = fewer retries

## Handling Budget Overruns

### When Hard Limit is Hit

Generation stops automatically. You have 3 options:

**Option 1: Wait for Reset**
- Daily: Resets at midnight
- Weekly: Resets Monday 12am
- Monthly: Resets 1st of month
- Best for: Planned budget adherence

**Option 2: Increase Limit**
- Go to Budget Settings
- Increase daily/weekly/monthly cap
- Effective immediately
- Best for: Unexpected campaigns

**Option 3: Emergency Override**
- Click "Emergency Override" button
- Removes limit for 24 hours
- Requires admin approval
- Best for: Critical deadlines

<Callout type="warning">
**Emergency overrides are tracked**: Use sparingly. Frequent overrides indicate budget needs adjustment.
</Callout>

### Budget Review Best Practices

Monthly review process:

1. **Check Actual vs. Budget**
   - Were limits appropriate?
   - Hit hard limit? Increase budget.
   - Under 50% used? Decrease budget.

2. **Analyze Cost Drivers**
   - Which playbooks cost most?
   - Which providers dominate?
   - Any failed generations?

3. **Adjust Strategy**
   - Optimize expensive playbooks
   - Switch providers where possible
   - Update generation frequency

4. **Update Limits**
   - Set next month's budget
   - Adjust soft limit threshold
   - Configure seasonal buffers (420, holidays)

## Playbook Budget Integration

Playbooks respect budget limits:

**Before Generation:**
1. Playbook estimates cost
2. Checks budget status
3. Proceeds only if under limit

**Example: Weekly Deals Video**
```
Estimated Cost: $0.75 (Veo 8s video)
Current Spend: $18.50 / $20.00 daily
Available Budget: $1.50
Status: ✅ ALLOWED (under limit)
```

**If Over Budget:**
```
Estimated Cost: $0.75
Current Spend: $19.80 / $20.00 daily
Available Budget: $0.20
Status: ❌ BLOCKED (would exceed limit)
Action: Playbook skipped, retry tomorrow
```

<Callout type="info">
**Playbooks auto-retry**: When blocked by budget, playbooks reschedule for next valid time (tomorrow for daily limits).
</Callout>

## Common Questions

**Q: What happens to scheduled playbooks when budget is exceeded?**
A: They're automatically paused and retry when budget resets (next day/week/month).

**Q: Can I set different budgets per agent or playbook?**
A: Not currently. Budget is per-organization across all media generation.

**Q: Do failed generations count against budget?**
A: Yes, provider charges apply even if generation fails. Monitor success rate.

**Q: Can I get refunds for failed generations?**
A: BakedBot doesn't charge for generation (we pass through provider costs). Contact provider support for refunds.

**Q: How do I export cost data for accounting?**
A: Go to Media Dashboard → Export → Download CSV with all transactions.

**Q: What if I need to exceed budget for a major campaign?**
A: Temporarily increase monthly limit before campaign launch, then reduce after completion.
