# Style Presets Library

Create consistent, on-brand AI-generated content with reusable style presets. Build your library once, use it everywhere.

## What are Style Presets?

Style presets are reusable templates that control the visual style of AI-generated images and videos:

**A preset includes:**
- **Style prompt**: Describes the desired aesthetic
- **Negative prompt**: What to avoid
- **Color palette**: Primary, secondary, accent colors
- **Typography**: Font family, size, weight
- **Aspect ratios**: Supported dimensions

<Callout type="tip">
**Think of presets as brand guidelines for AI**: Just like your brand guide defines logo usage and colors, presets ensure every AI-generated asset matches your brand identity.
</Callout>

## Why Use Style Presets?

### Brand Consistency

**Without Presets:**
```
Social Post A: Modern minimal aesthetic
Social Post B: Vintage film grain look
Social Post C: Bold cyberpunk style
Result: Inconsistent, unprofessional brand
```

**With Presets:**
```
All posts use "Brand Premium" preset
Result: Cohesive, professional feed
```

### Cost Savings

- **Fewer regenerations**: Get it right the first time
- **No experimentation waste**: Proven styles work
- **Faster iterations**: Reuse what works

**Example:**
- Manual styling: 5 attempts × $0.04 = $0.20
- Preset styling: 1 attempt × $0.04 = $0.04
- **Savings: 80% reduction**

### Speed

- **Skip prompt writing**: Preset handles styling
- **One-click generation**: Select preset → Generate
- **Consistent results**: No trial and error

## Creating Custom Presets

### Step 1: Access Preset Library

1. Go to **Dashboard → Media Center**
2. Click **"Style Presets"** tab
3. Click **"Create Custom Preset"**

### Step 2: Define Basic Info

**Preset Name**
Descriptive and memorable
- ✅ Good: "Brand Summer Collection 2026"
- ❌ Bad: "Preset 1"

**Description**
When and how to use this preset
```
Example: "Bright, energetic style for summer
social media posts. High saturation, warm
tones, outdoor lighting. Use for Instagram
and TikTok content."
```

**Tags**
Help find presets later
```
Examples: summer, social, energetic, outdoor,
instagram, seasonal
```

### Step 3: Write Style Prompts

**Style Prompt** (Required)
Describes the desired aesthetic:

```
Good Style Prompt:
"Professional cannabis product photography with
soft natural lighting, shallow depth of field,
white marble surface, minimalist composition,
subtle green accent color, premium luxury feel,
8k resolution, sharp focus"
```

**Negative Prompt** (Optional)
What to avoid:

```
Good Negative Prompt:
"blurry, low quality, cluttered background,
harsh shadows, neon colors, cartoon style,
text overlays, watermarks"
```

<Callout type="tip">
**Be specific**: "Soft natural lighting" is better than "good lighting". "Shallow depth of field" is better than "blurry background".
</Callout>

### Step 4: Configure Color Palette (Optional)

Add brand colors for consistency:

**Primary Color**
Main brand color (hex code)
```
Example: #2D5C3F (forest green)
```

**Secondary Color**
Supporting brand color
```
Example: #F5F5F0 (cream)
```

**Accent Color**
Highlight or CTA color
```
Example: #D4AF37 (gold)
```

**How Colors Are Used:**
- Image generation: AI incorporates colors naturally
- Video generation: Color grading, overlays, graphics
- Social posts: Background, text, elements

### Step 5: Set Typography (Optional)

Define text styling for video captions and overlays:

**Font Family**
```
Examples: "Montserrat", "Playfair Display",
"Roboto", "custom-brand-font"
```

**Font Size**
- Small: Captions, disclaimers
- Medium: Body text, product names
- Large: Headlines, CTAs

**Font Weight**
- Light: Elegant, minimal
- Normal: Standard body text
- Bold: Headlines, emphasis

<Callout type="warning">
**Typography only affects videos**: Image generation doesn't include text. Use typography settings for video captions, overlays, and animated text.
</Callout>

### Step 6: Choose Aspect Ratios

Select supported dimensions:

| Ratio | Dimensions | Best For |
|-------|------------|----------|
| **1:1** | Square | Instagram feed, Facebook |
| **4:5** | Portrait | Instagram feed, Pinterest |
| **16:9** | Landscape | YouTube, website banners |
| **9:16** | Vertical | Instagram Stories, TikTok |

**Recommendation:**
Select all ratios to maximize preset flexibility.

### Step 7: Test and Save

**Preview Generation:**
1. Click "Generate Test Image"
2. AI generates sample with your preset
3. Review results
4. Adjust prompts if needed

**Save Preset:**
1. Click "Save Preset"

## Using Presets

### In Playbook Automation

Configure playbooks to use specific presets:

**Weekly Deals Video Playbook:**
```yaml
Steps:
  - generate_video:
      style_preset: "Brand Summer Collection 2026"
      duration: 8
```

All videos generated by this playbook will use your preset automatically.

### In Agent Chat

Ask agents to use presets:

```
You: "Craig, create 3 Instagram posts for our
new gummies using the Modern Clean preset"

Craig: "I'll generate 3 posts with the Modern
Clean style. One moment..."
```

### In Media Dashboard

Manual generation with preset:

1. Go to **Media Center → Generate**
2. Select preset from dropdown
3. Add content prompt (what to show)
4. Click "Generate"

**Example:**
```
Preset: "Dark Luxury"
Content Prompt: "Premium live resin cartridge
on black marble with gold accents"
Result: Luxury product photo with preset styling
```

## Managing Your Library

### Organizing Presets

**Use descriptive names:**
- ✅ "Social Media - Bright Summer"
- ✅ "Product Photography - Premium"
- ✅ "Video - Cannabis Culture"
- ❌ "Preset 1", "Style A", "New"

**Tag consistently:**
```
Product presets: "product", "photography", "ecommerce"
Social presets: "social", "instagram", "tiktok"
Seasonal: "summer", "420", "holiday"
Brand: "luxury", "medical", "recreational"
```

**Archive unused presets:**
Keep library clean by hiding old seasonal or campaign-specific styles.

### Editing Presets

**Built-In Presets:**
- Cannot edit
- Clone → Edit clone → Save as new

**Custom Presets:**
1. Find preset in library
2. Click "Edit"
3. Update any field
4. Click "Save Changes"

<Callout type="warning">

</Callout>

### Sharing Presets

**Public Presets:**
Toggle "Make Public" when creating:
- Visible to all users in your organization
- Anyone can use in playbooks/agents
- Only creator can edit

**Private Presets:**
- Only visible to creator
- Use for experimental or personal styles
- Can make public later

## Best Practices

### 1. Start with Built-In

Don't reinvent the wheel:
1. Try built-in presets first
2. Find closest match to your brand
3. Clone and customize as needed

### 2. Create Preset Families

Group related presets:

**Example Family: "Product Line"**
- Product Photography - Premium
- Product Photography - Casual
- Product Photography - Medical

Use consistently across product types.

### 3. Test Before Rollout

Generate 5-10 test images:
- Verify consistency
- Check color accuracy
- Ensure prompt clarity
- Adjust if needed

### 4. Document Usage

Add usage notes in description:

```
"Use for Instagram feed posts only. Bright and
energetic for summer campaign (May-August).
Optimized for product close-ups and lifestyle
shots. NOT for medical products."
```

### 5. Regular Audits

Quarterly review:
- Archive unused presets
- Update outdated styles
- Create new seasonal presets
- Consolidate duplicates

## Advanced Tips

### Prompt Engineering

**Good Style Prompts:**
- Specific: "Soft natural window lighting" not "good lighting"
- Visual: "Shallow depth of field bokeh" not "blurry background"
- Complete: Include lighting, composition, mood, quality

**Common Patterns:**
```
[Subject] + [Style] + [Lighting] + [Composition] +
[Colors] + [Mood] + [Technical Quality]

Example: "Cannabis flower macro shot, modern
minimal style, soft diffused lighting, center
composition, white background with green accent,
clean professional mood, 8k sharp focus"
```

### Seasonal Presets

Create event-specific styles:

**420 Preset:**
```
Style: "Vibrant green smoke effects, purple
lighting, party atmosphere, energetic,
celebratory"
Tags: "420", "holiday", "celebration"
Active: April only
```

**Holiday Preset:**
```
Style: "Festive red and green tones, cozy warm
lighting, premium gift packaging, holiday decor"
Tags: "holiday", "gifts", "seasonal"
Active: November-December
```

### A/B Test Presets

Create similar presets with variations:

**Test:** Modern Clean vs. Modern Bold
```
Preset A: "Modern Clean" - Minimal, white, soft
Preset B: "Modern Bold" - Vibrant, color, contrast

Generate same content with both
Measure: CTR, engagement, conversions
Winner: Use for all future content
```

## Troubleshooting

**Preset not appearing in dropdown?**
- Check if set to Private (only you can see)
- Refresh page
- Verify preset was saved successfully

**Generated content doesn't match preset?**
- Style prompt may be too vague
- Negative prompt may conflict
- Content prompt may override style
- Try regenerating (AI has variability)

**Colors don't match brand exactly?**
- AI interprets colors creatively
- Use color hex codes in style prompt
- Add "exact color matching" to prompt
- Consider manual color grading after generation

**Preset works for images but not videos?**
- Verify aspect ratio is 16:9 or 9:16
- Check video provider supports preset features
- Some typography settings video-only

## Next Steps

- ✅ **Browse built-in presets**: Find your starting point
- ✅ **Create your first custom preset**: Clone and customize
- ✅ **Test with sample generations**: Verify quality
- ✅ **Add to playbooks**: Automate with consistency
