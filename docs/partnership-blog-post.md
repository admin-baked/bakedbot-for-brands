# Welcome to the Future of Cannabis Retail

We are excited to announce a groundbreaking partnership with BakedBot AI that will transform how we serve you. This collaboration brings state-of-the-art artificial intelligence directly into our operations, creating a more personalized, efficient, and enjoyable shopping experience.

## What is BakedBot AI?

BakedBot AI is a multi-agent commerce platform specifically designed for the cannabis industry. Unlike generic AI solutions, BakedBot understands the unique complexities of cannabis retail—from compliance requirements to product education and customer preferences. Their platform powers everything from product recommendations to marketing automation, all while keeping you in our brand's ecosystem.

## Meet Your AI Agent Team

Behind the scenes, a dedicated team of AI agents is now working to enhance every aspect of your experience:

### Smokey - Your Personal Budtender

Smokey is our AI budtender who knows our entire product catalog inside and out. Whether you're looking for help managing pain, improving sleep, or just exploring new strains, Smokey provides personalized recommendations based on your preferences and past purchases. Think of Smokey as your knowledgeable friend who's always available to help you find exactly what you need.

### Craig - Marketing & Content Creator

Craig handles all our marketing communications, from SMS promotions to email newsletters. But this isn't generic spam—Craig learns what products and deals interest you most, ensuring you only get relevant updates about products you actually care about. Craig also creates educational content to help you make informed decisions about cannabis.

### Money Mike - Pricing & Deals

Money Mike constantly monitors our pricing to ensure you're getting the best value. He identifies opportunities for bundles, manages our loyalty program, and creates personalized deals based on your shopping patterns. Mike's goal is simple: maximize your savings while maintaining our profitability.

### Deebo - Compliance Guardian

Deebo is our compliance enforcer, ensuring everything we do meets state regulations and industry best practices. From age verification to marketing content review, Deebo works 24/7 to keep us compliant so you can shop with confidence knowing we're operating legally and ethically.

### Ezal - Competitive Intelligence

Ezal keeps tabs on the broader cannabis market, monitoring trends, competitor pricing, and emerging products. This intelligence helps us stay ahead of the curve, stock the products you want, and price them competitively. Ezal ensures we're always offering you the best selection in the market.
