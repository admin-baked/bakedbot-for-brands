## 🚨 PRIORITY ZERO: Build Health

Before ANY work, verify the build is healthy:

```powershell
npm run check:types
```

| If Build Is... | Action |
|----------------|--------|
| 🟢 **Passing** | Proceed with task |
| 🔴 **Failing** | STOP. Fix build errors FIRST. No exceptions. |

**Current Status:** 🟢 Passing (verified 2026-02-25)

**Recent work (2026-02-26):** See `memory/MEMORY.md` for full log.

## 🦸 SUPER POWERS — ALWAYS AVAILABLE, USE THESE FIRST

> **Before spending 5+ tool calls investigating an issue, check if a super power solves it in ONE step.**

| # | Script | Command | When To Use |
|---|--------|---------|-------------|
| SP1 | Index Auditor | `npm run audit:indexes` | Check Firestore composite index status |
| SP2 | Secrets Provisioner | `npm run setup:secrets --deploy` | Provision GCP secrets for Firebase App Hosting |
| SP3 | Schema Validator | `npm run audit:schema --orgId=org_thrive_syracuse` | Validate Firestore data types across collections |
| SP4 | Test Data Seeder | `npm run seed:test` | Seed test org with 10 customers, 5 playbooks, 3 campaigns |
| SP5 | Code Scaffolder | `npm run generate:component MyWidget` | Generate boilerplate for components/routes/actions |
| SP6 | Build Error Fixer | `npm run fix:build --apply` | Auto-fix common TypeScript errors (import paths, console→logger) |
| SP7 | Security Tester | `npm run test:security` | Run 12 role-based access control scenarios |
| SP8 | Compliance Gater | `npm run check:compliance --text "..."` | Check content for medical claims, minors protection |
| SP9 | Consistency Checker | `npm run audit:consistency --orgId=...` | Validate org relationships and data integrity |
| SP10 | Monitoring Setup | `npm run setup:monitoring --deploy` | Configure Cloud Monitoring alerts for production |
| SP11 | Cost Analyzer | `npm run audit:costs` | Identify expensive Firestore queries |

**Quick-fire guide — when you're stuck:**
- Build broken? → **SP6** `npm run fix:build --apply` then `npm run check:types`
- Data looks wrong? → **SP3** `npm run audit:schema` + **SP9** `npm run audit:consistency`
- Need test data? → **SP4** `npm run seed:test`
- Security concern? → **SP7** `npm run test:security`
- Content compliance? → **SP8** `npm run check:compliance --text "..."`
- Slow queries? → **SP11** `npm run audit:costs`
- New scaffold needed? → **SP5** `npm run generate:component|action|route|cron <name>`

**Notes:** All scripts use `.env.local` for auth. SP8 requires `CLAUDE_API_KEY`. SP4 creates `org_test_bakedbot` (use `--clean` to reset).

---

## Workflow Protocol

**Every task follows this pipeline. No shortcuts. No exceptions.**

> **The AI Engineer Flow:**
> `Prompt → PRD (human strategy doc) → AI-Executable Spec (implementation contract) → Build → Review → QA`
> The PRD captures the *why*. The Spec captures the *exactly what and how* — every decision pre-made.

---

### Stage 0: PRD (Product Requirements Document)

On receiving any non-trivial task prompt, FIRST produce a **PRD** — a human-readable strategy document:

**PRD must include:**
- **Problem statement** — what user pain or business goal is being addressed
- **User stories** — who does what, and why
- **Acceptance criteria** — observable outcomes that define "done" (no implementation details)
- **Out of scope** — explicitly what this does NOT include
- **Open questions** — anything requiring a human decision before spec can be written

**PRD rules:**
- Written in plain English. No code, no file paths, no implementation decisions.
- Present to human. **Wait for explicit sign-off before proceeding.**
- If the task is trivial (< 20 lines, single file, no boundary triggers) → skip PRD, jump to mini-spec in Stage 1.
- If ANY boundary trigger fires (auth, payments, schema, cost, prompts, compliance, new integrations) → PRD required, no skip allowed.

**PRD sign-off unlocks Stage 1.** The PRD becomes the permanent record of intent and lives in `dev/prds/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name.md`.

---

### Stage 1: AI-Executable Spec (Implementation Contract)

Convert the approved PRD into an **AI-Executable Spec** using `.agent/spec-template.md`.

**This spec is NOT for humans — it is an execution contract for an AI engineer.** Every decision must be pre-made. No ambiguity. No "use your judgment." Linus reads this and builds it exactly as written.

**AI-Executable Spec must specify (exactly):**
- **Exact file paths** for every file created or modified (e.g., `src/server/actions/qa.ts`, `src/types/qa.ts`)
- **Exact Firestore field names and types** for every doc written or read (e.g., `regressionOf?: string`, `isRegression?: boolean`, `updatedAt: Timestamp`)
- **Exact component names** and their props interface (e.g., `<RegressionBadge bugId={string} area={QABugArea} />`)
- **Exact function signatures** with parameter types and return types (e.g., `getRegressionHistory(area: QABugArea): Promise<QABug[]>`)
- **Exact test cases** with literal inputs and expected outputs (e.g., `getRegressionHistory('brand_guide') → QABug[] where every item has status in ['verified','closed','fixed']`)
- **Exact prompt templates** for any agent injection (full text, not summaries)
- **Exact API contracts** — HTTP method, path, request body shape, response shape, error codes
- **Exact Firestore index definitions** — collectionGroup, fields, order, queryScope

**Spec rules:**
- Present spec to human. **Wait for explicit approval before writing any code.**
- If trivial task (< 20 lines, single file, no boundary triggers) → mini-spec inline:
  ```
  Mini-spec: [what] → [why] → [exact files] → [exact test inputs+outputs] → [rollback: revert commit]
  ```
- Boundary trigger → full AI-Executable Spec, no mini-spec.

---

### Stage 2: Build
Implement strictly within the approved spec scope.
- Write code + tests + logging in one pass.
- Follow Constitution §II (clean code, error handling, types, structured logs).
- Do not modify files outside the spec. Do not add unplanned dependencies.

### Stage 3: Self-Review
Run every item in `.agent/review-checklist.md` against your own work.
- Report the checklist results before committing.
- If any critical failure → stop and report. Do not commit.
- If minor issues → fix them, then re-run the checklist.

### Stage 4: Test & Eval
- Run the full test suite. Report results (pass/fail counts).
- If this task touched LLM prompts or agent behavior → run the relevant golden set eval from `.agent/golden-sets/`.
  - Smokey changes → `smokey-qa.json` (target: ≥90% overall, 100% compliance)
  - Craig changes → `craig-campaigns.json`
  - Deebo changes → `deebo-compliance.json`
- Report eval scores. If below threshold → do not commit. Iterate.

### Stage 5: Ship + Record
Only after Stages 0-4 are complete:
1. Commit with structured message (see review-checklist.md for format).
2. **Push to GitHub** — `git push origin main` **triggers Firebase App Hosting deployment to production**. Always push after committing finished work.
3. Update `CLAUDE.md` line 15 — build status one-liner.
4. Update `prime.md` recent work block — prepend new entry (commit hash + one-liner).
5. Update `memory/MEMORY.md` — full session details, gotchas, decisions.
6. Route to topic files if applicable (`memory/platform.md`, `memory/agents.md`, etc.).
7. If feature-flagged → note flag name and canary status.

### Escape Hatches
- **Hotfix (production down):** Skip Stages 0-1. Implement fix, run Stages 3-4, commit with `hotfix()` prefix. File retroactive PRD + spec within same session.
- **Docs-only change:** Skip Stages 1-4. Commit directly with `docs()` prefix.
- **Exploration/spike:** Produce PRD marked `status: 🔬 Spike`. Code is throwaway. Do not merge to main without promoting to full PRD → Spec → Build flow.

### 🐛 Bug Workflow (Auto-triggered on ANY mention of a bug, broken feature, or unexpected behavior)

When the user says anything like "X is broken", "X isn't working", "X still broken", "bug in X", "fix X" — execute this automatically, no extra prompting needed:

**Step 1 — Triage (30 seconds)**
Determine priority based on impact:
- **P0** — Production down, data loss, security breach, payment failure
- **P1** — Core feature broken for a paying customer (e.g., Thrive can't onboard)
- **P2** — Feature degraded but workaround exists
- **P3** — Minor UI issue, cosmetic, non-blocking

**Step 2 — File the bug (immediate)**
Write directly to Firestore `qa_bugs` collection via Admin SDK script:
```typescript
{ id, title, steps[], expected, actual, rootCause, priority, area,
  status: 'open', environment: 'production', affectedOrgId, reportedBy: 'claude-code',
  createdAt, updatedAt }
```
P0/P1 bugs trigger Slack notification automatically via `qa-notifications.ts`.

**Step 3 — Fix immediately**
- Read the broken component/action/service
- Identify root cause
- Apply fix
- Commit + push to production

Do NOT wait for the user to say "P1" or "file a bug first" — triage, file, and fix in one pass.

## 🔒 SECURITY RULE: NEVER HARDCODE SECRETS

**Secrets in code = blocked push + rotated credentials.** It happened (Slack webhook, 2026-02-17).

### The Complete 3-Step Pattern (ALL steps required):
```bash
# STEP 1: Create secret AND populate it (one command does both)
echo -n "secret-value" | gcloud secrets create SECRET_NAME --data-file=- --project=studio-567050101-bc6e8

# If secret already exists but has 0 versions (will also cause build failure!):
echo -n "secret-value" | gcloud secrets versions add SECRET_NAME --data-file=- --project=studio-567050101-bc6e8

# STEP 2: Grant Firebase access (Firebase CLI ONLY — not raw gcloud)
firebase apphosting:secrets:grantaccess SECRET_NAME --backend=bakedbot-prod

# STEP 3: Reference in apphosting.yaml — then push to deploy
```
```yaml
- variable: MY_SECRET
  secret: MY_SECRET          # ✅ Correct
  availability: [RUNTIME]

- variable: MY_SECRET
  value: "actual-secret"     # ❌ NEVER DO THIS
```
```typescript
// In code: always from env
const webhookUrl = process.env.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL;
// In scripts: env var with fallback
const SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL = process.env.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL || '';
```

### 🚨 Preparer-Step Failures (Build-Blocking)
When a secret is referenced in `apphosting.yaml` but is misconfigured, Firebase fails at the **preparer step** — before any compilation — blocking ALL deployments with `fah/misconfigured-secret`.

**Three causes, same error:**
1. Secret doesn't exist in Secret Manager
2. Secret exists but has **0 versions** (empty container — `gcloud secrets versions list` shows "Listed 0 items.")
3. Secret exists with data but no Firebase IAM binding

**Quick diagnostic:**
```bash
gcloud secrets versions list SECRET_NAME --project=studio-567050101-bc6e8
# "Listed 0 items." → add a version (step 1 above)
# Shows version(s) → run firebase apphosting:secrets:grantaccess (step 2)
```

See `.agent/refs/firebase-secrets.md` for full pattern, debugging checklist, and version management.

## 🆕 Super User Onboarding

### Promoting New Super Users to Admin Access
**Status:** ✅ Two-Script Solution — UID-based (recommended) + Email-based (backup)

**Method 1: UID-Based (Recommended)** ✅
```bash
node scripts/promote-super-user-by-uid.mjs <UID>
```
- **When to use:** Most reliable for new users who just signed up
- **Why:** Bypasses Firestore email indexing delay (can take 1-24h)
- Sets custom claims `{ role: "super_user" }` + creates/updates Firestore user doc

**Method 2: Email-Based (Backup)**
```bash
node scripts/promote-super-user-by-email.mjs <EMAIL>
```

**Finding the UID:**
1. Firebase Console → Authentication → Users → Click user → Copy UID
2. Browser DevTools → Application → Local Storage → `firebase:authUser:...`

**After Promotion:** User must re-login → auto-routed to `/dashboard/ceo` → full access to 28 agent tools.

## 🧭 Core Principles

1. **Build Health First** — A failing build blocks everything. Fix it immediately.
2. **Read Before Write** — Never modify code you haven't read. Use `Read` tool first.
3. **Small Changes** — One logical change at a time. Test after each.
4. **Plan Complex Work** — For multi-file changes, write a plan and get approval.
5. **Archive Decisions** — Record why, not just what. Future you will thank you.

---

## 🎯 Decision Framework: When to Read Refs

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Simple bug fix in one file | Read the file, fix it, test |
| Touching agent code | Read `refs/agents.md` first |
| Touching auth/session | Read `refs/authentication.md` + `refs/roles.md` |
| Adding new integration | Read `refs/integrations.md` |
| Multi-file feature | Read relevant refs + `query_work_history` |
| Unsure where code lives | Use Explore agent or search tools |

**Rule of Thumb:** If you're about to touch a subsystem for the first time in a session, read its ref file.

---

## ⚡ Essential Commands

| Command | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run check:types` | Before starting work, after changes |
| `npm test` | After code changes |
| `npm test -- path/to/file.test.ts` | Test specific file |
| `npm run lint` | Before committing |
| `git push origin main` | Deploy (triggers Firebase App Hosting) |

**Shell Note:** Windows PowerShell — use `;` not `&&` for chaining.

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Prevention | Super Power |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| Editing code without reading it | Always use Read tool first | — |
| Skipping build check | Run `npm run check:types` before and after | — |
| Build errors piling up | Auto-fix first, then manual review | **SP6** `fix:build --apply` |
| Large changes without plan | Break into smaller increments | — |
| Forgetting to archive | Use `archive_work` after significant changes | — |
| Assuming file structure | Use Glob/Grep to verify | — |
| Data integrity issues | Validate schemas and cross-org consistency | **SP3** + **SP9** |
| Security gaps in new routes | Run role-based access control tests | **SP7** `test:security` |
| Expensive queries shipping | Check query cost before/after changes | **SP11** `audit:costs` |
| Using `&&` in PowerShell | Use `;` instead | — |
| Runtime-only env vars at module level | Use lazy initialization (see Next.js Build Gotcha below) | — |
| Using `latest` for secrets in apphosting.yaml | **Always use explicit version numbers** (e.g. `@6`) | **SP2** `setup:secrets` |

### Firebase Secret Manager Gotcha: Explicit Version Numbers Required

**Problem:** Firebase App Hosting's preparer step resolves secrets during build time. The preparer requires `secretmanager.versions.get` permission to resolve the `latest` alias — which is different from the runtime accessor permission.

**Solution: Always Use Explicit Version Numbers**

❌ **BAD** (implicit `latest`):
```yaml
- variable: CANPAY_APP_KEY
  secret: CANPAY_APP_KEY
```

✅ **GOOD** (explicit version):
```yaml
- variable: CANPAY_APP_KEY
  secret: CANPAY_APP_KEY@1
```

**When Creating New Secrets:**
```powershell
# Create + populate
echo -n "secret-value" | gcloud secrets create SECRET_NAME --data-file=- --project=studio-567050101-bc6e8
# Grant access
firebase apphosting:secrets:grantaccess SECRET_NAME --backend=bakedbot-prod
# Reference in apphosting.yaml as SECRET_NAME@1
```

**Diagnosing existing secrets (before adding to apphosting.yaml):**
```bash
# 1. Check which secrets exist
gcloud secrets list --project=studio-567050101-bc6e8

# 2. Check if a specific secret has versions
gcloud secrets versions list SECRET_NAME --project=studio-567050101-bc6e8
# "Listed 0 items." → add a version. Shows "1 enabled" → just need IAM grant.

# 3. Grant IAM (even if secret already exists)
firebase apphosting:secrets:grantaccess SECRET_NAME --backend=bakedbot-prod
```

**Reading a secret value when you only have the service account (not user creds):**
The firebase-adminsdk service account does NOT have `secretmanager.versions.access`. Two workarounds:
- For `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` secrets (already public): read from `.env.local` via Node.js:
  ```bash
  node -e "const fs=require('fs'); const lines=fs.readFileSync('.env.local','utf8').split(/\r?\n/); console.log(lines.find(l=>l.startsWith('MY_VAR')).split('=').slice(1).join('='));"
  ```
- For other secrets: use `gcloud auth login` (user account) or grant the service account `roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor`

**Placeholder strategy for optional features:**
When a feature is optional (code already handles missing key gracefully), create a placeholder secret to prevent `fah/misconfigured-secret` build failure:
```bash
echo -n "PLACEHOLDER_ADD_REAL_KEY" | gcloud secrets create OPTIONAL_API_KEY --data-file=- --project=studio-567050101-bc6e8
firebase apphosting:secrets:grantaccess OPTIONAL_API_KEY --backend=bakedbot-prod
# Feature silently no-ops at runtime; replace with real key when ready
```

### Firebase App Hosting URL Gotcha: NOT `.web.app`

**Problem:** Firebase App Hosting uses a different URL format than traditional Firebase Hosting.

**Wrong URL:** `https://bakedbot-prod.web.app` (404 - Site Not Found)
**Correct URL:** `https://bakedbot-prod--studio-567050101-bc6e8.us-central1.hosted.app`

**Format:** `https://{backend}--{project}.{region}.hosted.app`

**Impact:**
- All test scripts must use the correct App Hosting URL
- Cloud Scheduler cron jobs must target the App Hosting URL
- API calls from external services must use the App Hosting URL

**Example Fix:**
```typescript
// ❌ BAD
const BASE_URL = 'https://bakedbot-prod.web.app';

// ✅ GOOD
const BASE_URL = 'https://bakedbot-prod--studio-567050101-bc6e8.us-central1.hosted.app';
```

### Next.js Build Gotcha: Runtime-Only Environment Variables

**Problem:** Next.js evaluates modules at build time. SDKs initialized with runtime secrets at module scope will fail the build even with `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`.

**Solution: Lazy Initialization**
```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: Lazy initialization that's build-safe
let _ai: Genkit | null = null;

function getAiInstance(): Genkit {
  if (_ai) return _ai;
  const apiKey = process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY;
  if (!apiKey) throw new Error('[Genkit] API key required');
  _ai = genkit({ plugins: [googleAI({ apiKey })] });
  return _ai;
}
```

**Real-World Example:** `src/ai/genkit.ts`

### Security Gotchas (Q1 2026 Audit)

| Gotcha | Correct Pattern |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Missing API auth** | Always use `requireUser()` or `requireSuperUser()` for API routes |
| **Trusting request body userId** | Get userId from `session.uid`, never from request body |
| **IDOR on org access** | Always verify org membership before operating on org data |
| **Dev routes in production** | Gate with `if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') return 403` |
| **Optional CRON_SECRET** | Always check `if (!cronSecret) return 500` before auth check |
| **Prompt injection** | Sanitize user data + wrap in `<user_data>` tags |
| **Using `console.log`** | Use `logger` from `@/lib/logger` instead |
| **Hardcoded credentials** | **NEVER** hardcode credentials. Use `process.env` or external secrets. |

**Authentication Patterns:**
```typescript
// For Super User operations (admin, cron jobs, sensitive data)
import { requireSuperUser } from '@/server/auth/auth';
await requireSuperUser();

// For authenticated user operations
import { requireUser } from '@/server/auth/auth';
const session = await requireUser();
const userId = session.uid; // Always use this, not request body

// For org-scoped operations
const hasAccess = await verifyOrgMembership(session.uid, orgId);
if (!hasAccess) return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Forbidden' }, { status: 403 });
```

**Cron Route Pattern:**
```typescript
const cronSecret = process.env.CRON_SECRET;
if (!cronSecret) {
  logger.error('CRON_SECRET environment variable is not configured');
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Server misconfiguration' }, { status: 500 });
}
if (authHeader !== `Bearer ${cronSecret}`) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 });
}
```

## 🚀 Auto-Approved Operations & Agent Autonomy (2026-02-20)

### Claude Code
**Explicit permission:** Execute these autonomously:
- Cloud Scheduler job creation/modification/execution
- Backfill commands (`POST /api/cron/backfill-*`)
- Cron job triggers (`POST /api/cron/*`)
- Deployments (`git push origin main` — after build pass)
- Service account setup (IAM operations)

### Linus (CTO Agent) — FULL AUTONOMY GRANTED
**See `.agent/LINUS_CTO_AUTONOMY.md` for comprehensive charter**

**CTO Powers:**
- ✅ Push code to production (`git push`)
- ✅ Auto-revert failed deployments (< 2 min SLA)
- ✅ Create/manage Cloud Scheduler cron jobs
- ✅ Fix production incidents autonomously
- ✅ Real-time Slack + dashboard reporting
- ✅ Infrastructure automation (service accounts)

**Safety Mechanisms:**
- Build validation gate (must pass before push)
- Destructive ops require human approval (critical jobs, secrets)
- Full audit trail (Firestore `linus-audit` collection)
- Hive Mind learning (Letta memory prevents recurrence)
- Incident auto-recovery (2-minute response SLA)

## 🛠️ DevOps & Operational Awareness

> Every agent should understand the production infrastructure they operate within.

### Deployment Architecture
```
git push origin main → GitHub Actions CI → Firebase App Hosting → Cloud Run (0-10 auto-scaling instances)
Build: npm test → tsup (embed widget) → next build --webpack → Firebase deploy --force
URL: https://bakedbot-prod--studio-567050101-bc6e8.us-central1.hosted.app
```

### Monitoring Stack
| Layer | Tool | Frequency | What It Checks |
|-------|------|-----------|----------------|
| Synthetic | k6 (GitHub Actions) | Every 15 min | /api/health, /thrivesyracuse, /llm.txt — SLA: p95 < 600ms |
| Heartbeat | Pulse system | Every 10 min | 60+ domain-specific checks (POS, inventory, loyalty, compliance) |
| System Health | Cron job | Every 30 min | Memory, CPU, latency, error rates, DB connectivity |
| Agent Telemetry | Firestore | Per invocation | Token usage, tool calls, latency, cost, capability utilization |
| Error Tracking | Sentry | Real-time | Client + server errors, session replays |

### Active Cron Jobs (47 endpoints)
Key schedules: POS sync (30 min), loyalty sync (daily 2 AM), playbook execution (daily + weekly), system health (30 min), pricing alerts, usage alerts, QA smoke tests.

### Alert Escalation Path
```
Cloud Monitoring alert → Slack #infrastructure
  ↓ (if P0/P1)
Auto-escalator → QA bug filed → Linus auto-dispatched → Slack #linus-incidents
  ↓ (if unresolved > 2 min)
Human escalation
```

### Agent Incident Runbooks
**Location:** `.agent/runbooks/agent-incidents.md`

Covers: hallucinated tools, infinite loops, cost spikes, forgetting super powers, quality degradation, cross-agent failures.

### Agent SLOs
**Location:** `.agent/specs/agent-slos.md`

Key targets: Linus P95 < 30s, error rate < 2%, super power utilization > 15%. Craig compliance > 99%. Smokey recommendation P95 < 5s.

### Cost Awareness
- Sonnet 4.5: $3/M input, $15/M output (default for all agents)
- Opus 4.5: $15/M input, $75/M output (auto-routed for strategic tasks only)
- Daily budget: $200 total across all agents
- Track via: `agent_telemetry` collection (costEstimateUsd field)
- Alert at: $50/day per agent, $200/day total
