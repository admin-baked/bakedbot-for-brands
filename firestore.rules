/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the BakedBot AI Assistant application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user-specific data
 * (orders, order items, and user interactions), while allowing public read access to
 * product catalogs and AI-generated content.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, secured via ownership.
 * - /categories/{categoryId}: Stores product categories, publicly readable.
 * - /products/{productId}: Stores product information, publicly readable.
 * - /users/{userId}/orders/{orderId}: Stores user orders, secured via ownership.
 * - /users/{userId}/orders/{orderId}/orderItems/{orderItemId}: Stores order items, secured via ownership.
 * - /content/{contentId}: Stores AI-generated content, publicly readable
