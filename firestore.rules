/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the BakedBot AI Assistant application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user-specific data
 * (orders, order items, and user interactions), while allowing public read access to
 * product catalogs and AI-generated content.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, secured via ownership.
 * - /categories/{categoryId}: Stores product categories, publicly readable.
 * - /products/{productId}: Stores product information, publicly readable.
 * - /users/{userId}/orders/{orderId}: Stores user orders, secured via ownership.
 * - /users/{userId}/orders/{orderId}/orderItems/{orderItemId}: Stores order items, secured via ownership.
 * - /content/{contentId}: Stores AI-generated content, publicly readable.
 * - /users/{userId}/interactions/{interactionId}: Stores user interactions, secured via ownership.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed for privacy.
 * - Top-level content and product catalogs are publicly readable.
 * - User-specific data (orders, interactions) is strictly controlled by the user's UID.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Path-based ownership is enforced for user-specific data, avoiding `get()` calls
 *   to parent documents for authorization.  The userId is present in the path of all
 *   user-specific data.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Public data (categories, products, content) is stored in top-level collections for public read access.
 * - Private user data (orders, interactions) is stored in user-specific subcollections.
